I was dancing the White Swan. It was different choreography, though. It was more like the Bolshoi's. It was the prologue, when Rothbart casts his spell. (CUTLERY RATTLING) (GASPS) Look how pink! So pretty. - BOTH: Pretty! - (BOTH CHUCKLE) - You're in a good mood. - Mmm-hmm. He promised to feature me more this season. Well, he certainly should. You've been there long enough. And you're the most dedicated dancer in the company. Up. What's that? - NINA: What? - There. Nothing. Sure you don't want me to come with you? You sweet girl. MAN: (OVER PA) This is a Downtown 1 train to South Ferry. Next stop, 72nd Street. Stand clear of the closing doors, please. VERONICA: Did you see Beth today? I can't believe she's back. MADELINE: Of course she's back. What, she can't take a hint? Company is broke. No one comes to see her anymore. Nobody actually comes to see ballet, full stop. That's not true. I heard The Royal had one of their best seasons yet. He just needs to try something new, that's all. No, someone new. VERONICA: (CHUCKLES) Like who? Like someone who's not approaching menopause. It's sad. What's sad? Beth's such a beautiful dancer. Yeah, so is my grandmother. (DANCERS GIGGLE) Well, Fonteyn danced into her 50s. Yeah, we know. Soloists? Great! (CHUCKLES) I fucking missed my stop. Had to hoof it all the way from 79th. VERONICA: (WHISPERING) Who's that? GALINA: (WHISPERING) It's that new girl from San Francisco. Okay. (PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) BALLET MISTRESS: And up, two, three, four. Good, one... Two, three, four, up... Beautiful as always, Nina. Relax. And one, and two, and three, and four, and... Stop, John. One second. (PIANO STOPS) Okay, take position. (PIANO RESUMES) And one, and two, and three, and up. One, and two, and three, and four... - How are you, dear? - Good, thanks. We all know the story. Virginal girl, pure and sweet, trapped in the body of a swan. She desires freedom, but only true love can break the spell. Her wish is nearly granted in the form of a prince. But before he can declare his love, her lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him.",

You were late, so I called Susie in the office. An audition. I can't believe he just sprang that on you. So? It was fine. Just fine? - (SOBBING) - Oh, sweetheart. You tell me about it. I know, Susie, but he just can't expect these girls to come back from break and dance like Beth Macintyre. It's completely unrealistic. And they can do the work, but they don't have Beth's magic...

The truth is, when I look at you, all I see is the White Swan. Yes, you're beautiful, fearful, fragile. Ideal casting. But the Black Swan? it's a hard fucking job to dance both. I can dance the Black Swan, too. Really? In four years, every time you dance, I see you obsess, getting each and every move perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself. Ever. All that discipline, for what? I just want to be perfect. (SOFTLY) You what? I want to be perfect. (SCOFFS) (LAUGHS) Perfection is not just about control. It's also about letting go. Surprise yourself, so you can surprise the audience. Transcendence. And very few have it in them. I think I do have it in... Ah! You bit me? I can't believe you bit me! I'm sorry.

        "Hey, it's up. Veronica? Congratulations. VERONICA: Hey! Why would you say that? Hmm? Your idea of some sick joke? What? Fuck you.  GIRL: Oh, my goodness! Hey, Nina! Congratulations! Congratulations. Oh, Nina, congratulations. You were so beautiful in your audition. I knew you were going to get it. - Congratulations! - Congratulations!  - ERICA: Hello? - Hi. - What it is? What's wrong? - I'm fine. What is it? He picked me, Mommy. - Did you hear me? - For Swan Lake? - I'm gonna be the new Swan Queen. - Oh, my God! Well, um... I'll be home soon. I just wanted to let you know. I love you. I love you, too. Hurry home!  Mom? Mom, are you in your room?  ERICA: Nina, are you home?  Nina, when you get out, I'm in the kitchen. Come on, sweetie. My daughter, the Swan Queen.  It's our favorite. Vanilla with strawberry filling. Mom, not too big. Oh, that's way, way too much. It's a celebration. It's just this once. Mom. My stomach's still in knots. Fine. - Fine. Then it's garbage. - No, Mom. Don't. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm just so proud of you. It looks so yummy. Mmm!      - THOMAS: Okay, thank you. Thank you. -  Thank you, Nina. It's very nice. It's very nice. But I knew the White Swan wouldn't be a problem. The real work will be your metamorphosis into her evil twin. And I know I saw a flash of her yesterday. So get ready to give me more of that bite. Up, and... BALLET MISTRESS: Excellent. That evil force is pulling you, that you can't escape. That's just like... Out of your control. You sense it. You get aware of it more. \"It's taking. It's taking me.\" A little bit more desperate. Right. And you can maybe go up a little bit, and then come down. That's it.  BALLET MISTRESS: Long arms. Feel the space. That's beautiful. Step, and step, and... ?paulement, and again. Watch the way she moves. Imprecise, but effortless. She's not faking it. BALLET MISTRESS: Long arms. Gorgeous. Yes. - Okay, that's beautiful. - Sorry. BALLET MISTRESS: We'll start again from the beginning. LILY: Okay. Sorry. SUSIE: Welcome to the principals' room. You room with Beth from now on, so be considerate."

Your heart is broken, wounded. Your life force fading. The blood drips. The Black Swan stole your love. There's only one way to end the pain. You're not fearful, but filled with acceptance. And you look down at Rothbart, and then at the Prince, and then, yes, at the audience. And then you jump! Come on, go ahead. Jump, you'll be fine. Jump! (CROWD APPLAUDS) Okay, everybody gets a drink of water, then it's notes. Hmm? (PANTING) You lost weight. Take off your shrug, please. Very good. Face front. We're almost done. And that's it.

Why don't you just go on, I'll catch up later. - What's going on? - Lily. You made her my alternate? Well, there's always an alternate. - Lily's the best choice. - No, but she wants my role. Every dancer in the world wants your role. No, this is different. She's after me. - She's trying to replace me. - Nobody's after you. No, please believe me! I know it's been a struggle. But you just had a breakthrough this morning. Tomorrow is yours. Just give a great performance and you won't have to worry about Lily or anybody else. Now go home and rest. From the vision again.
