Peter, I got some really interesting news this morning. Aldous gave you gonorrhoea? No. Why would I tell you that? Crime Scene was cancelled. Whoa. Wow. - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've been waiting to take the next step, you know, into features for a long time, so it's a really good thing. This isn't The View. I mean, we can have an honest talk about this if we want. I don't wanna step out of the spotlight and then be forgotten. I don't wanna disappear. I'm freaked out. I wanna be honest. I'm really freaked out right now, okay? Because, seemingly, the only actresses that actually can survive are the ones that show their cooter, and, excuse me, but I refuse to do that. I have a little dignity. And I don't have the frame to support plastic surgery. I would tip over. And I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna exploit myself. Listen, you're gonna be fine. You have a long career ahead of you. You've got, like, four years until you're 30. It's gonna be fine. - How are you? - I'm screwed. Frankly, I don't stand a chance. No, I'll be fine. I've been quietly stealing money from you for a long time. You're always good at cheering me up, Pete, thank you. (SINGING) Die Die Die I can't It's really good, Peter. I just don't understand it. I don't. I mean, just chalk it up to that. Please don't play it again, 'cause I don't... Just listen to it one more time and see... Where's Aldous? - Mr Snow, may I ask you a question? - Okay. I want to please my wife here, on our honeymoon, but I don't know what I'm doing.",

I could totally use a friendly hangout, so... All right. I don't know if you want, instead of Lazy Joe's, I was thinking of going to Laie Point right now. - Really? - Yeah. I heard that place was a pain in the ass. RACHEL: Okay. - Hey! - DWAYNE: Yo, what's up, guys? PETER: We're just going for a hike. No, you're not, you're going snorkelling. PETER: I think we're gonna go on a hike. It is sea turtle fucking season, dude. Let's go. They fuck for three hours, dude. I mean, that's magical. - No, we're going on a hike. - I think we'll go on a hike, yeah. What? Your loss. Why won't anybody go snorkelling with me? How you doing back there? Awesome. I don't think I've ever been this covered in sweat before. It's like I have some sort of fever. I told you this was a pain in the ass. Could've been at Lazy Joe's. - Oh, yeah. - Uh-huh. Oh, shit. - You good? - No. (LAUGHING) PETER: Wow, we're really going up to the edge of this, huh? Look! Wow, this is really beautiful. All right, so now that your show's done, are you gonna finish the Dracula musical? It's not that easy, you know. Sarah always thought it was crazy, and... Well, you're definitely crazy. But so is everyone, right? So who cares? - I just don't feel like doing anything. - Why? 'Cause my heart is broken, and I can't imagine doing anything right now. It's probably the same reason you don't go back to school, you know? Maybe it's good we got hurt like that, you know? I don't know about you, but it makes me feel impervious to pain. Yeah. Kind of like there's nothing left to be afraid of. - Yeah. No, exactly. - Right. We could leap off this rock, and it won't hurt us as bad as they did. So jump, then. No, I meant that, like, as a metaphor, you know? No. Just do it. You'll be fine. Jump. What the hell? Oh, God! Oh, God. I made her kill herself!

Is there a place to get good sushi around here? Yeah. Yeah, there's a really great place about five minutes from here called Asuki. Perfect. - Do you want me to get you a map? - Please. Okay. So, this is where we are. Head down Kamehameha, and then pass Funaho Loko Marsh. And it should be right to the left. It might take, like, five minutes. - Great. Thank you. - Any time.

Have a great dinner, you guys. - Thank you. You're welcome to join us, obviously, if you want. - Okay. - Wouldn't dream of it. What? What? - Oh, okay. - Okay. - RACHEL: That's great. Awesome. - Sure. Great. I'll just set two more places. - Okay. - Not a big deal. Awesome. So this is actually happening. We're gonna let this happen. I am so sorry. I never thought in a million years she would say yes. I did. What? I just accepted an invitation. I didn't wanna be rude. It's got us in a terrible situation. Now I'm gonna have to sit with him wearing this shirt all night. You're wearing the shirt regardless. Australia is amazing. - I'm telling you. It is a great place to shoot. - Yeah? Rachel, you would love it. You would love it. I wanna go. I really, really wanna go there. - Wait, so when's the movie coming out?"

No, it's ridiculous. Here's my favourite scene. Ring-ring. Hello? - ALDOUS: Right. It would never happen. - Yeah. No, it could never happen. It's a metaphor for addiction to technology.

Can I get cranberry juice with a bit of lime in it, please. Do you want cranberry juice or cranberry cocktail? Because I can probably rustle up either one. Throw some OJ... I don't care. Okay, great. Hey, can we get another bottle of wine? If I've learned anything from addiction, it's that, you know, life is as brief as the twinkling of a star over all too soon. So if you're in a situation where you're with a woman, why not do the most interesting thing that you can do in that situation? And by which, I don't mean have a conversation, have a chin-wag, a bit of a chat. Lose yourself in something that's both ancient and perennial. Find something eternal, perpetual. Lose yourself in fuck. I'm going to disagree. Respectfully, of course, sir. Maybe for you, that works. For me, it's much more enjoyable to get to know somebody.

And even if I was, I don't think that I have the sexual competency to really pull that off. Yeah. It's a gift. I will say, if you do get back with Miss Marshall, handle with care, because, you know... Okay. Well, I think my ride's here. So I'm gonna skedaddle then before anything else happens to me. Before life gets any more daft. Is someone gonna take that? Listen, don't let them grind you down. Take it easy. Hey, look at my driver. I'm gonna have sex with her. He said it was clear I wasn't over you. And then he left. Fucking prick. And then I started thinking, what if he's right? What if I'm not over you? - Sarah... - Please just let me finish, Pete. What if I made a really, really horrible mistake? - Sarah. - Yeah? - Sarah. - Yeah? Stop pulling my face towards your face. Why? You don't like it?
