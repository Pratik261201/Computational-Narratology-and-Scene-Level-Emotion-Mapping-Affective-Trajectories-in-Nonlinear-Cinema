And it's the first day of fall. So in honor of that fact, we have Elke Putzkammer, professor of literature at Union College, to talk about autumn in poetry and literature. Good morning, professor. - Hi, Alex. So, what about it? Why do so many people write about the fall? Well, I think it's seen as the beginning of the end, really. If the year is a life, then September, the beginning of fall, is when the bloom is off the rose and things start to die. It's a melancholy month and maybe because of that, quite beautiful. Is there something you might read to us? Oh, I'd love to. Whoever has no house now Will never have one. Whoever is alone will stay alone Will sit, read, write long letters Through the evening And wander the boulevards Up and down, restlessly While the dry leaves are blowing. Goodness, that harsh, isn't it? Well, perhaps. But truthful. Mommy, done. Okay. Good morning. - Good morning. I tried not to wake you. Well, thanks. You didn't. I just-- You know, I couldn't get up. Caden, can you get that? It's Maria, I don't want to. Caden-- Oh, that's weird. Hey, it's me. How are you? Mommy, is something wrong with my poop? No, honey, it's just green. I'll try your cell. You probably ate something green. I didn't. What's wrong with me? I have to get that, Olive. You're gonna be fine, okay? But, Mommy-- Yeah, I'll be right back, Olive. Oh, nothing. Just wiping Olive's ass. You? An earthquake in Kashmir-- Oh, you're kidding. Holy fuck. --has killed an estimated 73,000-- I don't feel well. Oh, my goodness. --march in Washington, D.C., today, October 15th. Harold Pinter died. Well, he's old, right? No, wait. He won the Nobel Prize. Mom. - What, honey? Do you need to look at my poop? You sure it's all right? - It's fine, Olive. Just flush. What if it's alive? What if I kill it? It's green like plants. - It's not alive, honey.",

No. An ophthalmologist. I said, ophthalmologist. Do you hear that? Yeah. And today is Tuesday. Mommy, is today Tuesday? No, honey, today is Friday. So, what exactly did he say?

Sorry. I have rehearsal. - Fuck. Hey, come on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Everybody, sorry. How many years until I have to get more shots? Not for a really long time, babe. A million years?

Yeah, Dr. Heshborg said I should see a Dr. Scoriano. My pupils don't work. I think I have blood in my stool. That stool in your office? When I was pregnant with Olive. What was it like? I don't know. Hopeful or something. Like something was gonna change. Yeah, something did. No? - Yeah. Yeah, of course. - I mean, bigtime. I mean, maybe not as much as I'd hoped. I'm sorry. That's a terrible thing to say. There are no terrible things to say in here, only true and false. Can I say something awful? Yes, please do. I've fantasized about Caden dying. Being able to start again, guilt-free. I know that's-- That's bad. Caden, does that feel terrible? - Yeah. Okay, good. It's a nightmare in there. I'm sorry. So I'm reading The Trial. Yeah? - Yeah. You like? - Love. I'm such an idiot for not knowing about this book. It's famous, as it turns out. - Yeah. You're not an idiot. Then you say: \"In fact, Hazel, you're very bright, and I love your eyes.\" In fact, Hazel, you're very bright. Oh, am I? And I love your eyes. Do you? Oh, you're a darling. Then what do I say? I can't say what then you say. - Why? Because it's dirty. Could you--? Could you step out for a second? Go ahead. I've seen boy parts. Can I take a piss in your sink? Yeah, sure. I guess. We're sold out. Great. Gorgeous. Thanks. How was rehearsal? Awful. We have, uh, 560 lighting cues. I don't why I make it so complicated. Because that's what you do. Yeah. We got through it though. - That's really pretty. Caden, I'm sorry, I-- I can't-- I can't come tonight. I'm sorry. I have two canvasses I have to get ready to ship for tomorrow.

You can sleep here. Where are you going to sleep? The living-room couch. Don't you want to sleep with me? It's just sex. Okay. If you think it's okay. How can you be like that? I get undressed every day. In front of someone is different. I don't see why. Maybe because you have a beautiful body. Maybe that makes it easier. Yeah, I suppose it might. Do you want to fuck? I do. Um, do you? Take your clothes off. I'm sorry. I'm very, very lonely. I don't, ah... know what's wrong. I-I just-- I'm sorry. Do you understand? I mean, can--? Can you understand loneliness? Yeah. I mean-- I don't know, I-- I feel okay, mostly. Fucking might help. I'm sorry. It's okay, I don't mind. Take your clothes off. You're very pretty. Thanks. Sometimes I wish I could be pretty like that. What, you wish you were a girl? Sometimes I think I might have been better at it. Interesting. It's kind of a drag in a lot of ways. Do you like guys? No. I only love women. Well, I'm getting cold. You're pretty, Caden. Thanks for saying that. Come to bed, pretty Caden. I shouldn't have drunk so much fucking beer last night. What are you gonna do about it? Get lunch. What are you going to do? For chrissake. - Good, Roland. Thanks, Caden. We need to fire him. We don't need to fire him. Jeremy's playing to us. Tell him to talk to Donna and we'll hear what we hear. Sammy's explaining too much. It feels expository. It needs to be shorthand, like, \"Jeremy, big.\" Caden, can we stop a second? Sure. If Hazel's in love with Sammy, and Caden's in love with Hazel there would be a big confrontation where Caden turns to me and says: \"It's obvious he's a substitute for me.\" Then I think Hazel would have a good moment where she cries or gets ang-- Gets angry, I'm not sure which, but I think it's sound-- That didn't happen."

There was supposed to be something else. You were supposed to have something, a calm. Love. Children. A child, at least. Children. Meaning. Everything okay, Eric? Everything is everything. He hates me. I disappointed him, and he hates me. Everyone is disappointing when you know someone. I remember having that picnic with my mother. Look at me. Ellen, what is it? I was so young. I'm going to remember this moment for the rest of my life, Mama, and in exactly 20 years, come here with my daughter and have exactly the same picnic. There was so much hope. Baby, that the loveliest thing I've ever heard. Oh, God. Sorry, Mommy. I'm sorry. Where is my little girl? Where is my little girl? Where is my little girl? Look at the night table for a note from Adele. Adele died of lung cancer last night. You may stay on if you like. Stare out the window. Remember the time she got you to pose for one of her paintings? How she told you how beautiful you were? How she made you feel pretty again for a little while? Think how you'll miss her. Stand up. Now it is waiting, and nobody cares. And when your wait is over, this room will still exist... ...and it will continue to hold shoes and dresses and boxes and maybe someday another waiting person. And maybe not. Freedom. Two, four! The room doesn't care either. Hello? There's nobody running the elevator anymore. What was once before you, an exciting and mysterious future is now behind you, lived, understood, disappointing. You realize you are not special. You have struggled into existence and are now slipping silently out of it. This is everyone's experience. Every single one. The specifics hardly matter. Everyone is everyone. So you are Adele, Hazel, Claire, Olive. You are Ellen. All her meager sadnesses are yours. All her loneliness. The gray, straw-like hair. Her red, raw hands. It's yours. It is time for you to understand this. Walk. As the people who adore you stop adoring you as they die, as they move on as you shed them, as you shed your beauty, your youth as the world forgets you, as you recognize your transience, as you begin to lose your characteristics one by one as you learn there is no one watching you and there never was, you think only about driving.",
