That's not fair. What? Practicing's not fair. You're still on for 10 tomorrow, right? You're still coming? Uh, yeah, sure. We have to launch the boat. Can you give us a hand, in about 20 minutes?

Who did you talk to about the game tomorrow? With her. - When? - Day before yesterday. - And? - Nothing, she was fine. Where's Jenny? I don't know, sweetheart. Maybe she's at the beach or inside. - Who were those guys? - Don't know. Maybe relatives. Doesn't her brother have a son that age? Don't put that there. Take your stuff upstairs, please. Yeah. Keep the doorway clear or someone's gonna trip. We have a lot more in the car. Hey, are you listening to me? I'm going, already. Open the windows, please. We need to let some air in. Yeah, Mom. Get out, Lucky. Out. Come on, get down. Come on. - George? - Yeah? Where are the other groceries? I'll get it. Golf clubs were in the way. Hurry up, everything's getting warm. This cooler's a piece of shit. Stop it, buddy. You'll knock me over. Go to Mommy, go on, go to Mommy. She'll give you a treat. The meat's in the other box. Will you grab it for me? I'm just opening the windows. Leave the shutters in the front, it'll get too hot. Lucky, come on. Honey, get out. Will you...? Come on, I'll get you something in a minute. Lucky, please. Will you call the dog, honey? Lucky, get out of here. - Call the dog. - Lucky. Go on, honey. Come here, come to Daddy. Stop it, Lucky. Be quiet. I'm sorry. He's... He's nuts. Come in. Hey there, Fred. Good to see you. Thanks for helping. It'd be pretty hard on my own. No problem. This is Paul. - Pleasure to meet you. - Pleasure. Paul's father is a business associate of mine.

It ain't all the time. Last year when I was in Miami it rained cats and dogs the whole time. And you were up here and you were swimming every day, remember? Still, it sucks that Jenny isn't here. It's boring without... Careful. I am being careful. That was an expensive overhaul. See? Not a single scratch. Well, now you can help me put up the boom. You got it? Yeah. - Put it down over there. - Okay. But she told me she'd be here the whole time. Yeah, well, I don't know either. I don't know why she told you that. Maybe she went out with a friend. We'll ask her mother tomorrow when we see her. Anyway, forecast for tomorrow is wind. Why was Uncle Fred behaving so strangely? Well, I'm not surprised. She got pretty worked up about it last time. Come on, just forget about it. She's not gonna change. Yeah, well, you're only gonna upset yourself. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Oh, they're great. They're outside playing on the boat. Uh... I don't know, 5, 5:30. My kitchen clock's not working, so I have to get that fixed on Monday. Yeah, exactly, that's what I'm doing right now. We're having steak. It all defrosted, so now I have to get rid of it. You should come on out. Yeah, that was stupid of me. I froze 4 pounds of steak... ...now I'm standing here looking at half a cow. I'm not joking. Come on out, please, just for the weekend. Well, tell him not to be so difficult. Hold on a second. - What is it, honey? - We need a sharp knife. Okay. - I'd like to see it again. - Okay. - Tell your father. - Okay. So, what do you think? Well, tell your sweetheart to bring his laptop with him. Jump in the car, and you'll be here in an hour. Well, he shouldn't be so antisocial. Come on, we've got enough steak for the whole week. What is it? Hold on. Okay. All right. Well, listen, just call me and let me know, all right? Okay, all right, Nancy. - Bye. - Bye. What now, honey? - There's someone here. - Where? At the door.",

How many does she need? Four. Four? What for? - Excuse me? - What for? What does she need the eggs for? I mean, what's she cooking? I have no idea. So are they okay just like this or do you need the carton? Whatever you want. How did you get in here? Down there. I mean, down by the water. But you're not wet. There's a hole in the fence. By the water, not in the water. Fred sh... I mean, Mr. Thompson, knows about it. He showed it to me. Oh, I see. So you sure they're okay like this? Yeah, yeah. That's okay. No problem. - Thank you very much. Thank you. - All right. Say hello to Eve. Tell her we're looking forward to the game tomorrow. I'll tell her. Thanks again. Thanks to Fred and your friend for help... - Shit. - What happened? It's not a disaster. We have to go grocery shopping on Monday anyway. I'm really sorry. It's not so bad. None of us eat eggs for breakfast anyway. So the disaster's under control. Well, thank you. I'm sorry, I should have paid more attention. Well, you shouldn't cry over spilt milk, right? You're really nice. You do what you can. I really am sorry. I'm very clumsy, you know? I think I have two left hands. - Then you're the man for carrying eggs. - Yes, you could say that. So, what are we going to do now? Well, we have a lot of steak, but we might be expecting guests... ...and they definitely eat eggs for breakfast. You'll still have four left. It's a box with a dozen, isn't it? Or am I mistaken? No, you're not mistaken. So would you like the carton this time? - It's not necessary. - Are you sure? But if you insist. If I insist? Well, it might be better, I guess. - Oh, God. - What? Oh, no. I'm sorry. Before you destroy the rest of the kitchen... ...maybe you should take the eggs and leave. All right? Yes. No carton? I'm really sorry. Honestly. Me too. Here you go. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'll tell Mrs. Thompson how nice you were. Do what you have to do. Have a nice day. Excuse me? Lucky. Lucky.

Be quiet. - What's the matter with him? - I don't know. It's probably too hot for him too. I'll take a look. It's wonderful. It really makes a difference, like night and day. Thanks a lot. Sure.

Just give Tom the eggs, and we won't bother you anymore. Excuse me? We'll have to tell Eve and Fred. Nothing like this has happened to me before.

I'll hit it towards the bay. Yes? If it makes you happy. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Really. Thank you. Excuse me. He loves golf. We both do. - Excuse me? - We both do. We both love golf. Lucky! Lucky.

I'd like to apologize for before. But you have to admit, George, the slap in the face? It really wasn't the most appropriate reaction. I'm Paul. This is Peter. Come here, Tom. Where are your manners? Shake the man's hand. Here, take this for the pain. What's this now? What, are we shit to you? What, didn't we just agree that? Jesus Christ! It's okay. It's okay.

Listen, if the weather stays like this, you'll probably have to take the car. - It's supposed to be windy. - For tomorrow... - Where's your dock? - Excuse me? Your dock? Oh, it's just around the peninsula, but on the other side. The old cottage, with the red dock? Right. It's very beautiful. Well, thank you, we enjoy it. Well, anyway, it's good to see you. All right, goodbye. So you're here all week? Well, this week for sure. Maybe we'll come by tonight. Oh, do, you know we love seeing you. All right. We'll see how George is doing. Yeah, see how he is. Bye-bye. - Bye. - Bye. They'll be here in two hours... ...and then this little charade of yours will be over. Sorry, but that's not exactly true. Didn't you ask your friends to call and confirm... ...or did I misunderstand something? They'll come, even if they can't reach us. Is lying allowed? Just a second. Wait, let me move this out of the way. Why don't you have a landline? Don't you find it convenient? Or is it that you aren't out here that much? Please, have a seat. You know you can be completely open with us. You'd feel better. We're being completely open with you. Right there. You should put a pillow under him. You know, if you'd let Peter help you, it would hurt less. I'm happy to help, really, I just don't want to impose. Careful with... That's a good idea, put it up. That should be more comfortable. So there we are. - You sure you don't wanna put a pillow...? - Could you please stop this? You're asking? What? You said, \"Please.\" I'm very happy about this. It's easier when things are polite. I'd like to apologize for before. But you have to admit, George, the slap in the face? It really wasn't the most appropriate reaction. I'm Paul. This is Peter. Come here, Tom. Where are your manners? Shake the man's hand. Here, take this for the pain. What's this now? What, are we shit to you? What, didn't we just agree that? Jesus Christ! It's okay. It's okay. Stop it now, otherwise your mother will get hurt. Stop it! Do you understand?"
