Pull the other one. I am, and this is my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master. - What? Ridden on a horse? - Yes. - You're using coconuts! - What? You've got two empty halves of coconut, and you're banging them together. So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land. - Through the Kingdom of Mercia. - Where did you get the coconuts? We found them. Found them? In Mercia? The coconut is tropical. - What do you mean? - Well, this is a temperate zone. The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. - Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? - Not at all. They could be carried. - What? A swallow carrying a coconut? - It could grip it by the husk. It's not a question of where he grips it. It's a simple question of weight ratio. A five-ounce bird could not carry a one-pound coconut. It doesn't matter. Go tell your master that Arthur from Camelot is here. In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right? - Please! - Am I right? - I'm not interested. - It could be carried by an African swallow. Oh, yes! An African swallow, maybe. Not a European swallow. That's my point. I agree with that. Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot? But then, of course, African swallows are non-migratory. - Oh, yes. - They couldn't bring a coconut, anyway. Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows carried it together? - No, they'd have to have it on a line. - Simple. They'd use a strand of creeper. - Held under the dorsal guiding feathers? - Why not? Bring out your dead! Ninepence. - Bring out your dead. - Here's one. Ninepence. - I'm not dead! - What? - Nothing. Here's your ninepence. - I'm not dead! - He says he's not dead. - Yes, he is. - I'm not! - He isn't? - He will be soon. He's very ill. - I'm getting better! You'll be stone dead in a moment. I can't take him like that. It's against regulations.",

Who lives in that castle? - No one lives there. - Who is your lord? - We don't have a lord. - What? I told you. We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune. We take turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week. - Yes. - But all the decisions of that officer - are ratified at a biweekly meeting. - Yes, I see. - By a majority in the case of internal affairs. - Be quiet! - By a two-thirds majority in the case of... - Be quiet!

May we burn her? - Burn her! - How do you know she is a witch? - She looks like one. Bring her forward. - I am not a witch. - But you are dressed as one. - They dressed me up like this. - We didn't! And this isn't my nose. It's a false one. - Well? - Well, we did do the nose. - The nose? - And the hat. But she is a witch. Burn her! - Did you dress her up like this? - No. Yes. Yes, a bit. She has got a wart. - What makes you think she is a witch? - Well, she turned me into a newt. A newt? I got better. - Burn her anyway. - Burn her! Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch. - Are there? What are they? Tell us. - Do they hurt? Tell me, what do you do with witches? Burn them! - What do you burn apart from witches? - More witches! - Wood. - So, why do witches burn? - 'Cause they're made of wood? - Good. So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood? - Build a bridge out of her. - Can you not also make bridges of stone? Oh, yeah. Does wood sink in water? - No. - It floats. Throw her into the pond! - What also floats in water? - Bread. - Apples. - Very small rocks. - Cider. Cherries. - Gravy. Mud. - Churches. - Lead. A duck! Exactly. So, logically... If she weighs the same as a duck... She's made of wood. And, therefore... - A witch! - A witch! We shall use my largest scales. Right. Remove the supports! - A witch! - A witch! - It's a fair cop. - Burn her! Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science? - I am Arthur, King of the Britons. - My liege. Good Sir Knight, will you come to Camelot, and join us at the Round Table? My liege, I would be honored. - What is your name? - Bedevere, my liege. Then I dub you Sir Bedevere, knight of the Round Table. The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights. But other illustrious names were soon to follow. Sir Lancelot the Brave. Sir Galahad the Pure.

May we burn her? - Burn her! - How do you know she is a witch? - She looks like one. Bring her forward. - I am not a witch. - But you are dressed as one. - They dressed me up like this. - We didn't! And this isn't my nose. It's a false one. - Well? - Well, we did do the nose. - The nose? - And the hat. But she is a witch. Burn her! - Did you dress her up like this? - No. Yes. Yes, a bit. She has got a wart. - What makes you think she is a witch? - Well, she turned me into a newt. A newt? I got better. - Burn her anyway. - Burn her! Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch. - Are there? What are they? Tell us. - Do they hurt? Tell me, what do you do with witches? Burn them! - What do you burn apart from witches? - More witches! - Wood. - So, why do witches burn? - 'Cause they're made of wood? - Good. So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood? - Build a bridge out of her. - Can you not also make bridges of stone? Oh, yeah. Does wood sink in water? - No. - It floats. Throw her into the pond! - What also floats in water? - Bread. - Apples. - Very small rocks. - Cider. Cherries. - Gravy. Mud. - Churches. - Lead. A duck! Exactly. So, logically... If she weighs the same as a duck... She's made of wood. And, therefore... - A witch! - A witch! We shall use my largest scales. Right. Remove the supports! - A witch! - A witch! - It's a fair cop. - Burn her! Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science? - I am Arthur, King of the Britons. - My liege. Good Sir Knight, will you come to Camelot, and join us at the Round Table? My liege, I would be honored. - What is your name? - Bedevere, my liege. Then I dub you Sir Bedevere, knight of the Round Table. The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights. But other illustrious names were soon to follow. Sir Lancelot the Brave. Sir Galahad the Pure.

But we are nice, and we will attend to your every, every need! You are the keepers of the Holy Grail? - The what? - The Grail. It is here? But you are tired, and you must rest awhile. Midget! Crapper! - Yes, O Zoot? - Prepare a bed for our guest. - Thank you, Zoot. - Thank you. Away, away, varletesses! The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big. - Look, I... - What is your name, handsome knight? Sir Galahad the Chaste. Mine is Zoot.

Bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear. We are just not used to handsome knights. Nay. Come. You may lie here. - But you are wounded! - No, it's nothing! You must see the doctors immediately. Please, lie down. - Well, what seems to be the trouble? - They're doctors? They have a basic medical training. Come, come, you must try to rest. Dr. Piglet!

Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot. She is a bad person, and must pay the penalty. Do you think this scene should have been cut? We were so worried when the boys were writing it. But now we're glad. It's better than some previous scenes, I think. At least ours was better visually. At least ours was committed. It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes. - Get on with it. - Yes. Get on with it! Get on with it! - I am enjoying this scene. - Get on with it! Wicked, wicked Zoot! She must pay the penalty. In Castle Anthrax, we have one punishment for setting alight the Grail-shaped beacon. You must tie her down on a bed, and spank her. A spanking! A spanking! You must spank her, and after you've spanked her, deal with her as you like. - And, then, spank me. - And me! - And me. - And me. Yes. You must give us all a good spanking!

Hello, stuffy English knights and Monsieur Arthur King, who has the brain of a duck, you know. So, we French fellows outwit you a second time. How dare you profane this place with your presence? I command you, in the name of the knights of Camelot, to open the doors of this sacred castle, to which God himself has guided us. How you English say? One more time, I unclog my nose in your direction, sons of a window-dresser! So, you think you could out-clever us French folk with your silly knees-bent, running about, advancing behavior. I wave my private parts at your aunties. You cheesy lot of second-hand, electric donkey-bottom biters! In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred castle!"
