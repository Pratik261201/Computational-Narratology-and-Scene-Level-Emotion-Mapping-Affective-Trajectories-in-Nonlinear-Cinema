RUDYARD: Honey, it's not good for you to be checking on the baby every five minutes and imagining one terrible thing or another. - I know. I know. - Here it starts. Here we go. Rudyard... Rudyard, she's not breathing. Honey, she's sleeping. The baby's sleeping. No. Rudyard, it's crib death. It's sleep! She's asleep, honey. - Maybe. - Come on! (EMMA MURMURS) Emma! (EMMA WHIMPERS) - Oh, good. - (EMMA CRIES) That's better. No, thank you. - Thanks. Emma? - Glad to help. He was one of the most dependable men that ever worked for me. - I know. Thank you. - He was a good man. Hey, I'm real sorry about your daddy. Take care of your momma. Emma. Emma, wake up, please. - Wake up. - What's wrong? I was tense. I was tense, and I was wondering how you were feeling. - Would you like to sleep in my bed? - No, thank you. Would you like to sleep in my bed again? Yes! What are we gonna do with this hair? PATSY: Hey, Emma. Patsy, hurry up! You're going to miss him. That's what they were looking at! (LAUGHS) - Good night, honey. - Where's Momma? She's out back with that old fart who's trying to get in her pants. Aren't you gonna wait and see if the astronaut shows up? They've got one on every corner in Houston! Come on. I gotta get my bus. - Okay. Say hi to Race for me. - Okay. - Okay. - Love you. Astronauts! - So? - We better get going. I'm gonna say goodbye to my mother. You want to go with? No. I don't think I'm up to it today. Sure would be nice to have a mother somebody liked. Why don't you face up to the fact that you have certain biological needs? - Because I don't. - EMMA: Mom! I'm going now. Excuse me. (CHUCKLES) Can you believe it? He wants to take me to Tahiti. (SCOFFS) I don't know why you treat these men like this. They have feelings, too. Ouch. You always make so much of things. - Has the astronaut moved in yet? - Ow! Who? \"Who?\" Is Patsy teaching you coy lessons? Breedlove, Garrett. Next door. Has he moved in? - Put your socks up! - All right. Come say goodbye to Patsy. 11:00. You be home by 11:00, and no later than 11:00. Say goodbye to Patsy. - Goodbye, Patsy! - Thank you. PATSY: Goodbye, Mrs Greenway.",

(SINGING ALONG TO ANYTHING GOES) I feel really foolish getting stoned to hear Mary Martin. See, Patsy, this is not Mary Martin. This is Ethel Merman. This is the last time we're gonna be like this. I just plain refuse to get into that kind of thinking, Patsy. It should not stop. I mean, we're gonna be best friends. Our babies are gonna be best friends. We're all gonna grow up and be best friends. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) - Emma? - EMMA: Oh, God! - Just a minute, Ma. - AURORA: Open the door. - Emma? - Yes. - Open the door, please. - Just a minute, Ma. What do you mean? - Emma, I need to talk to you! - All right. I'm getting married. What the hell? (AURORA GROANS) (PASTY MUTTERS) AURORA: Would you meet me in my room? Yes. (WHISPERING) What do you think she wants? I don't know. Maybe she's going to tell you how to have sex. (CHUCKLING) What? No. She only knows how to avoid it. (BOTH LAUGH) - Okay, hang on. - I can't believe you just said that. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it, I swear. AURORA: What have you been doing, Emma? Nothing. What is it, Momma? I really would like to get some sleep so I could look halfway decent for tomorrow. Come on. What is it? You wouldn't want me to be silent about something that's for your own good, even if it might hurt a little, would you? Yes, ma'am, I certainly would! (LAUGHING) (CONTINUES LAUGHING) Okay, come on. Come on. I've been in here all night. I've been trying to decide what wedding gift to get you. I thought of that Renoir that my mother gave me. But I couldn't reach a conclusion. Then I came to grips with the reason why I couldn't think of a wedding gift for you. Momma, it's all right. I need dishes of any kind, CorningWare, a rotisserie, the car, a house. Emma. I'm totally convinced if you marry Flap Horton tomorrow, it will be a mistake of such gigantic proportions, it will ruin your life and make wretched your destiny. Why are you doing this to me? You are not special enough to overcome a bad marriage. Emma, use your brains. Flap is limited. He hasn't got any imagination. Even at this age, all he wants is a secure teaching job. Mother, I'm marrying Flap Horton tomorrow. I thank God for Flap for getting me out of here.",

No, really. (CAR ENGINES STARTING) - Thanks. - Good night. Oops! (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) - I bought you something. - What? A tie. Emma. You didn't buy this tie for me. You were worried about how I was gonna look to your mother. Now I wish you would stop being such a quisling where she is concerned. Why is it every time I get happy, you turn perverse? - Buying this tie made you happy? - Yes! Yes! I wish you could understand this, 'cause you really don't. I mean, it made me very happy, buying this tie. I went to two or three places before I finally found the right place. And then describing your jacket to the salesman and knowing how perfect it would match with what you were wearing, which, by the way, it certainly does. I mean, it was fun! It was a goddamn Mardi Gras, and you're just too dumb to understand that kind of happiness! I'm sorry. I'm being terrible. Going to your mother's, it makes me a little irrational. - Can I help? - Yes. Thank you, Flap. Would you take this candle to Emma? I need another one. - In the kitchen? - Yes. That looks great. Who's that short gentleman? Not that it's any of your business, but... Just leave it at that. What are you looking at? She isn't there any more. She'll be back. I'm Edward Johnson, Aurora's friend. Pleased to meet you. Vernon Dahlart. God, isn't she something? Here she comes. I met her two weeks ago at church. I guess you might say she's God's gift to Vernon Dahlart. - Then you like her? - Oh, no. Does it show? (VERNON CHUCKLES) Good food. Well, this is what I used to serve when I lived in Boston. Vernon, you haven't said a word. Is that right? I feel like I haven't stopped talking since I came in. I guess because I've been thinking about you so much.

        "Can't you stay a little while longer? I thought we were having a real good time, didn't you? Listen, don't go yet. One more minute. No, I've got something I want to show you. No, really.  - Thanks. - Good night. Oops!  - I bought you something. - What? A tie. Emma. You didn't buy this tie for me. You were worried about how I was gonna look to your mother. Now I wish you would stop being such a quisling where she is concerned. Why is it every time I get happy, you turn perverse? - Buying this tie made you happy? - Yes! Yes! I wish you could understand this, 'cause you really don't. I mean, it made me very happy, buying this tie. I went to two or three places before I finally found the right place. And then describing your jacket to the salesman and knowing how perfect it would match with what you were wearing, which, by the way, it certainly does. I mean, it was fun! It was a goddamn Mardi Gras, and you're just too dumb to understand that kind of happiness! I'm sorry. I'm being terrible. Going to your mother's, it makes me a little irrational. - Can I help? - Yes. Thank you, Flap. Would you take this candle to Emma? I need another one. - In the kitchen? - Yes. That looks great. Who's that short gentleman? Not that it's any of your business, but... Just leave it at that. What are you looking at? She isn't there any more. She'll be back. I'm Edward Johnson, Aurora's friend. Pleased to meet you. Vernon Dahlart. God, isn't she something? Here she comes. I met her two weeks ago at church. I guess you might say she's God's gift to Vernon Dahlart. - Then you like her? - Oh, no. Does it show?  Good food. Well, this is what I used to serve when I lived in Boston. Vernon, you haven't said a word. Is that right? I feel like I haven't stopped talking since I came in. I guess because I've been thinking about you so much. Can I give you a suggestion on how to handle me, Vernon? Yes, ma'am. Don't worship me until I've earned it. Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate any advice you can give me. - Don't talk with your mouth full, Vernon. - Oh!  VERNON: I wouldn't do that, really. I just did it to make you laugh.

I'm grateful. - No problem. - Come on, Mom. - Wait over by the car a second, honey. - Come on! - Wait over by the car, honey. - No! Come on! - (STERNLY) Wait over by the car, honey. - But... (SHOUTING) Wait over by the car, honey! Over by the car! Now! Now! Now! Nice boys. You're great with them, too. Really. I think all three of us are going through a stage. - Hey, thanks again. - Oh, no thanks required. - I've had a lovely time. - Me, too. - I'll get the money back to you. - Oh, don't bother yourself. You could just drop it in the mail if you like. - To the bank? - Sure. You could even use a cheque-by-mail envelope. Or you could come in. Whichever. Maybe I'll come in some time. Well, that'd be fine. - Hey, can I help you with that? - No, thanks. I'm used to this. And so, another birthday for a gal named Aurora Greenway. Even though 50, she still takes my breath away. Mere mortals just gaze as she lights up their sky. A heavenly object, a siren's cry. You're the best. Happy birthday. - Thank you, Edward. - Excuse me, Aurora. Thank you. Do you want one, Vernon? Would you like a kiss? You're not lying about your age, are you? Of course not. I thought you were 52. She's really 52. Come on, Aurora, how do you expect to fool a family doctor? - It seems to me she said her age. - Thank you, Vernon. Thank you. My point is, the number doesn't matter, but the effort to conceal it does. - Rosie, why does he keep talking? - Dr Ratcher... Damn it, I'm trying to do some good here! - Now, the way to adjust to old age... - ROSIE: Doctor. Doctor, I think you're a mite confused, because of being recently widowed and all. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) You okay? Hmm? VERNON: Aurora? Aurora? Let's give her some privacy. (DOORBELL BUZZES) GARRETT: Yeah? The door's open. Just a minute. Well, hello. Hi. I was curious if you still wanted to take me to lunch. I wasn't aware that we... I don't know what you... A few years back, you invited me to lunch. - A few years back? - That's right. I wondered if the invitation still exists. Would you like to?",

        "Anyway, this one time, I'm looking out the window. I see a piece of the spacecraft, and it's whistling along the ground. It doesn't make a sound. The only sound you hear, the only noise in the entire world is your heart beating. Ah.   It's indescribable. Anyway, I can't think of a better way of saying it, but that was it. That was my moment, the one that doesn't go away. You know what I mean? Yes. Mmm. Hey. This is my moment.   No, don't get nervous, Garrett.   Flap? Anybody?   WOMAN: You don't think it's love because we're having fun. Love can be fun. Would you stop making faces?   That's wonderful. FLAP: I think what we have here is a typical grad school girl crush. Would you please, please, please stop telling me that this is just a crush? Janice, the whole fun with getting involved with someone who is unavailable and a little bit older is that sometimes you get to hear what's really going on. - Flap, you are such a... - Incredible asshole!   Excuse me. - Excuse me. - MAN: Watch it, buddy! Emma. God damn it, Emma. You're gonna ruin us! - 'Cause you're a spectacle! - I am not! Stop jiggling her like that. She's gonna throw up. Your timing was perfect. You caught us before we did anything. I'm taking the car, and I'm gonna take the kids. I'm gonna go to Houston. Give me the baby. You don't know what I did. You don't know. Just like I don't know what you do on your little afternoon drives. Take the... STUDENT: Professor Horton, can I speak to you about my grade? You ought to be happy that I'm going off. If I stayed here, I'd make life hell for you. Don't follow me. Excuse me. Excuse me.  It's them. It's them!  - Garrett, you're gonna meet Emma. - No, you don't need outsiders. - You're no outsider! - I'll see them later. Please, come with me. Em, Em, this is Garrett. Oh! - The one... - Pleasure to meet you. I've heard so much about you. Your mother's really been looking forward to this, too. So, go ahead. - Anything wrong, Garrett? - No. It was very nice to have met you. Must be nice to be home, huh? Oh, it's great. It's great. I'll be over later.
