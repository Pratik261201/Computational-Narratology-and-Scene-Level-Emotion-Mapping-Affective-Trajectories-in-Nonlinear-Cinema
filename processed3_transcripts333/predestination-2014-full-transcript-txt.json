      "raw_text": "What if I could put him in front of you? The man that ruined your life? If I could guarantee that you'd get away with it would you kill him? The Blackmore Cross. I understand it's your second. Congratulations. You have served honorably. So that's it? The order from the board will come through shortly. The final order? Yes. And the Bomber? It's not your problem anymore. I don't need to remind you of the critical nature of your final mission. So please rest. Every suspect educates us. Makes us better at what we do. No more than this elusive sociopath. He's efficient. Precise with his timings. The press have dubbed him the Fizzle Bomber. We stopped him this time. But this was only a small attack. This is his grand plan. March 1975. He keeps changing the day. The explosion will level 10 blocks of New York and leave over 11,000 dead. Everything we've done to stop him has failed. But I was close this time. Just one more try. Grafts have taken. The reconstructive transplant is stable. But you understand you will look different to what you remember. Eyes will heal. You should recover well for this final mission. And then I'll be decommissioned. It's not just the physical injuries. You've logged more field hours than any of the other agents I've been assigned to. The risks are real. The scars have begun to heal nicely. Your vocal cord damage has reduced but will not regrow exactly the same way. There goes my singing career. It will take some getting used to. I've changed so much that I doubt my own mother would recognize me. The order finally came through today. I guess it was inevitable. By the time you listen to this seven years will have passed. Our first mission is just as important as our last. Each one getting us closer to our final destination. Sir, please raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to uphold the rules and regulations - set forth by T.B.R. Code 7286? - I do. Do you accept that any diversion from your mission parameters will result in immediate court martial? And if convicted death by lethal injection. I do. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Time. It catches up with us all. Even those in our line of work. I guess you could say we're gifted. God, Jesus, it sounds arrogant saying that out loud. All right. I'll put it a better way.",

Yeah, well it's tough making a living, that's for sure. What do you know about tough? As much as the next guy, I guess. How about as much as an unmarried mother? What does that mean? Four cents a word, I write confession stories. \"The Unmarried Mother\" is my pen name. Are you serious? Yeah. Right. Right! How's business? Business is okay. I have a weekly column. I write them, they print them, I eat. Right? - What, you read my work? - Yeah, yeah. Does that surprise you? - Yeah, a little. - Why? You don't fit the demo. The demo? - The demographic. - Right.

You know, it seems to me you've got a real hit on the woman's angle. - Woman's angle? - Yeah. Yeah, I know the woman's angle. I should. Why, you married? You got sisters? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. The one thing that this job has taught me is that truth is stranger than fiction. I have heard some incredible shit. Nothing astonishes me anymore. You don't know what incredible means. Yeah? Well, try me. Here you go. I got that. Forget it, man. I'm not telling you. You're scared it's not good enough. - You think that'll work? - Yeah.

Hey, man. - Two Buds, bud. - Right. Mayor Davidson, how do you respond to the fact that many New Yorkers are leaving the city in fear of a fifth attack by the Fizzle Bomber? We've got extra police patrols on 24 hour shifts around the city. We've created a joint task force with the Federal Bomb Squad and the FBI in order to track down the suspect. What a stupid name. \"Fizzle Bomber.\" The guy makes compressed RDX-based explosive compounds. That's not easy. \"Fizzle Bomber\" is easier to remember. I hate that name. Makes it sound like his bombs just fizzle. Like they don't do any real damage. I don't think anybody's doubting how dangerous this asshole is. Well, there's a lot of selfish assholes out there needing a good shake up. They should be afraid. Well, he's killed 112 people already. Some people just gotta go. Stops the gene pool right in its tracks. Yeah. Maybe he's doing the city a favor. Better be careful who hears you say that. What, you think I'm wrong? I'm just saying that kind of talk can get you in trouble. No worse than I've already been through. Now listen, you keep promising the best story of my life. But I'm not hearing anything. All right.

Roberta Cowell? Yeah, yeah, they had sex change. So you... Don't interrupt. It was September 13th, 1945. I was a foundling. A newborn left on an orphanage doorstep. City of Cleveland Orphanage. That's a good girl. Well, there's no signs of trauma or exposure. The child appears healthy. If she shows any signs of infection or excessive coughing, she should be taken to the hospital for a thorough examination. Yes, Doctor. She got a name? Jane. Jane will have to do for now. I'll be back to check on Jane in a week. I look forward to it. Don't worry, sweetheart. We'll take good care of you now. I was just one of a dozen babies who had no past. But that was all we had in common. I was never sick, not one day. So I was never taken to a hospital. Not until later in my life. Slow down. One chocolate ice cream - for the cute little lady. - Thank you. When I was little, I envied kids with parents. I always wondered what it would be like. Stupid kid! Get off the damn street! Little shit! Jane! Come here now. Son of a bitch! I never understood why my parents abandoned me. What had I done that was so wrong? But as I got older, I knew something was different about me. Sex confused me, you know? The way it works, the way everything fits. I felt different. And even back then, I knew that I was going to be different from all the other girls. I made a solemn vow that any kid of mine would have both a mom and a pop. A real family. It kept me pure. Away from temptation. So I focused my attention on more important things. Like learning how to fight. Fight! Fight! - Come on, Lucy, go! - Come on! What'd you call me? Pinky, four-eyed, little bitch... I was tough. Much stronger than any of the other kids. Even the boys. All right, break it up! - Jane, come with me! - Let go! - What's wrong with you? - I didn't do anything! And I was smart too. Top of the class. Equals... Jane! Jane. How do you ever expect to learn anything if you never... Fifteen. Math and physics were my favorite subjects. - That's correct. - It all came easy for me. Retard. Enough! When I got older, I realized I stood little chance of getting married for the same reason I hadn't been adopted.",

Yes, Doctor. She got a name? Jane. Jane will have to do for now. I'll be back to check on Jane in a week. I look forward to it. Don't worry, sweetheart. We'll take good care of you now. I was just one of a dozen babies who had no past. But that was all we had in common. I was never sick, not one day. So I was never taken to a hospital. Not until later in my life. Slow down. One chocolate ice cream - for the cute little lady. - Thank you. When I was little, I envied kids with parents. I always wondered what it would be like. Stupid kid! Get off the damn street! Little shit! Jane! Come here now. Son of a bitch! I never understood why my parents abandoned me. What had I done that was so wrong? But as I got older, I knew something was different about me. Sex confused me, you know? The way it works, the way everything fits. I felt different. And even back then, I knew that I was going to be different from all the other girls. I made a solemn vow that any kid of mine would have both a mom and a pop. A real family. It kept me pure. Away from temptation. So I focused my attention on more important things. Like learning how to fight. Fight! Fight! - Come on, Lucy, go! - Come on! What'd you call me? Pinky, four-eyed, little bitch... I was tough. Much stronger than any of the other kids. Even the boys. All right, break it up! - Jane, come with me! - Let go! - What's wrong with you? - I didn't do anything! And I was smart too. Top of the class. Equals... Jane! Jane. How do you ever expect to learn anything if you never... Fifteen. Math and physics were my favorite subjects. - That's correct. - It all came easy for me. Retard. Enough! When I got older, I realized I stood little chance of getting married for the same reason I hadn't been adopted."

Wouldn't you agree? Yes, sir. I work for an organization whose primary purpose is not space travel. It's reshaping wrongdoings. We use Space Corp, among others, as a means of finding people who are special. They are what you might call a recruitment agency. I don't understand. A recruitment agency for what? For people with exceptional abilities. People like yourself. People without families. Without husbands and wives and children. No past. No ties to the future. You see, the work we do is complicated and it requires employees with advanced motor skills, remarkable memories. It's a job for the best and the brightest. For the elite. The elite? I couldn't believe it. Seemed like I had a bright future ahead of me. I didn't really understand what the job meant. They were very covert and secretive but I knew it would change my life for the better. And they didn't insist on virgins. They were different to Space Corp. It wasn't until my skirts got tight that I realized my future was over. You were pregnant? Yeah, wouldn't you know it? My mystery man had left me with more than just a broken heart. So that bright future, that girl who was elite? She was gone. And I never saw Mr. Robertson again. With nowhere to go I landed in a charity ward surrounded by other big bellies and trotted bedpans until my time came. I never felt so alone. One night I found myself on an operating table with a nurse saying... Relax, Jane. Relax. Now breathe deeply. How do you feel? Tired. That's natural. A cesarean can be difficult. You pulled through fine. A cesarean? Doctor, is my baby okay? Your baby's fine. Is it a boy or a girl? It's a healthy little girl. Seven pounds three ounces. You know it's something... to have made a baby. I remember thinking I would tack on the admission form \"Mrs.\" Let her think her papa was dead. No orphanage for my kid. But then the surgeon kept talking. What is it, Doctor? Have you ever had a thorough examination before? Yes. What'd the doctors tell you? Nothing. I thought everything was fine. So no doctor's ever told you that your internal set up was different than most?",

When we performed your operation we found something very unique. One of a kind, actually. After I successfully removed your baby I called for the Chief of Surgery. We held consultation and we worked for hours to reconstruct you the best we could. Reconstruct? You had two full sets of organs, Jane. Female and male. Both immature but the female set well enough developed for you to have a baby. But I'm afraid, my dear, the excessive bleeding from the birth forced us to perform a hysterectomy. We had to remove your ovaries and uterus. What are you saying? But the reconstruction allowed us to create a male urinary tract. Further surgeries will be required. To become a man? Is this some kind of joke? I'm afraid it's not. You're young. Your bones will readjust. We'll watch your hormonal balance. It's not a death sentence. Your life can continue. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. Have you thought of a name yet? Well, I was thinking of Jane, after her mother. I guess it was a way of keeping the name in the family. After all, I knew eventually I would have to change mine. That's a good name. My feelings changed to cold determination. I had to do right by my baby Jane. But two weeks later that didn't mean anything. Why? She was snatched. - Snatched? - Yeah. What do you mean \"snatched\"? Kidnapped. Stolen from the goddamn hospital nursery. I mean how's that for taking the last a man's got to live for? When the nurse had her back turned, someone walked in and walked out with her. Were there any clues? Any description? Just a man. With a face-shaped face. Like yours or mine. No! No! Could have been the baby's father. The nurse swore it was an older man but who else would swipe my baby? What'd you do? Filed a missing person's report. Checked adoption agencies, orphanages. You name it, I did it. But nothing. It's like she vanished. And they never found the guy? Never.

You know, I've been called a freak my whole life. Now I really was. Just a lab rat to be experimented on. I'm so sorry. - Yeah, right. - I am. I've had a lot of people tell me how sorry they are for what happened to me. I don't want to hear it anymore. Then what do you want? What does anyone want? Love. Fuck love. A purpose. A purpose? You don't have that? I'm working on it. Why can't love be a purpose? Hippy bullshit. It's easier to hate than to love, right? Yeah. It's easier to destroy something. Kill somebody. You think you could do that? Maybe. I see it in your eyes, too. That bitterness. It can take over. It can. Well, you know if you don't move forward you fall backwards into a river of shit. So Anyway, rather than getting angry and pissing away my entire future I knew I just had to get on with my life. So I changed my name and came to New York. I got by as a fry cook but the hours were long and the money was horseshit. So I bought a typewriter and set myself up as a public stenographer. What a laugh. In four months I typed six letters and one manuscript. The manuscript was for Real Life Tales and a total waste of paper. But the jerk who wrote it, sold it. Which gave me an idea. I bought a stack of confession magazines and studied them. The words came easy. The Unmarried Mother was born. So, now you know how I get the authentic woman's angle on an Unmarried Mother story. Through the only version I haven't sold. The true one. So, do I win the bottle? Not bad. Not bad. So, is that it? Story's over? Yeah, afraid so. The man that ruined my life is a ghost and so is my daughter. I guess at some point you just gotta let things go. And have you? Fuck no. What if I could put him in front of you? The man that ruined your life. And if I could guarantee you that you'd get away with it. Would you kill him? In a heartbeat. I know where he is. Yeah, of course you do. No bullshit. And how the hell do you know that? There are records. Hospital records, orphanage records, medical records... Been there, done that. Beth Fetherage. Wasn't that the name of your caretaker at the orphanage? Beth? You son of a bitch. Have you been following me?",

Now I really was. Just a lab rat to be experimented on. I'm so sorry. - Yeah, right. - I am. I've had a lot of people tell me how sorry they are for what happened to me. I don't want to hear it anymore. Then what do you want? What does anyone want? Love. Fuck love. A purpose. A purpose? You don't have that? I'm working on it. Why can't love be a purpose? Hippy bullshit. It's easier to hate than to love, right? Yeah. It's easier to destroy something. Kill somebody. You think you could do that? Maybe. I see it in your eyes, too. That bitterness. It can take over. It can. Well, you know if you don't move forward you fall backwards into a river of shit. So Anyway, rather than getting angry and pissing away my entire future I knew I just had to get on with my life. So I changed my name and came to New York. I got by as a fry cook but the hours were long and the money was horseshit. So I bought a typewriter and set myself up as a public stenographer. What a laugh. In four months I typed six letters and one manuscript. The manuscript was for Real Life Tales and a total waste of paper. But the jerk who wrote it, sold it. Which gave me an idea. I bought a stack of confession magazines and studied them. The words came easy. The Unmarried Mother was born. So, now you know how I get the authentic woman's angle on an Unmarried Mother story. Through the only version I haven't sold. The true one. So, do I win the bottle? Not bad. Not bad. So, is that it? Story's over? Yeah, afraid so. The man that ruined my life is a ghost and so is my daughter. I guess at some point you just gotta let things go. And have you? Fuck no. What if I could put him in front of you? The man that ruined your life. And if I could guarantee you that you'd get away with it. Would you kill him? In a heartbeat. I know where he is. Yeah, of course you do. No bullshit. And how the hell do you know that? There are records. Hospital records, orphanage records, medical records... Been there, done that. Beth Fetherage. Wasn't that the name of your caretaker at the orphanage? Beth? You son of a bitch. Have you been following me?"

The onset of psychosis, dementia. That can be serious. I'm fine. Time travel can be disorienting. Don't ever exceed the jump limit. It can be problematic. The snake that eats its own tail forever and ever. I know where I come from. But where do all you zombies come from? Oh, my God. You look good. I missed you. You're the Fizzle Bomber? We always hated that name, remember? You're a murderer. No, no, no. See, I've saved lives, more than I ever could have from inside the bureau. No, you kill innocent people. Innocent people. No, no, no. I have clippings from the future. Clippings from futures that never happened because I prevented them. More tragedies prevented, lives saved. You see this? - Saved? - Yeah, yeah. Look. Look. 1974, Chicago chemical spill. That driver never made it to work in the morning. Now, 324 lives saved. Look, look. What's next? What's next? Right, well we have... We have 1991, April 3rd, Hamburg, Germany. 1,861 lives saved. The Hardshaw Weapons Factory Heist, 1968. You know, the terrorists never came in the building because I blew it the fuck up. 3,027 lives I saved. Do you keep count of all the civilians you killed as well? Your next attack will kill 10,000 more. You're disappointed in me, right? I remember that, I do. But when the dust settles I think you'll see that we did the right thing. I will never become you. No, I'm curious. Did you report that your decommissioned Field Kit didn't decommission? Right? Some people say that it's fate. But you and I, we know some things are predestined. I made you who you are. You made me who I am. It's a paradox, right? But it can't be para-doctored. Right? I had so much fun at preempting you, I did. And now you're free and you found me and we can be together.",
