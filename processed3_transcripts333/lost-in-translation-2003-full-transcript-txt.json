I'll call Charlie and those guys. Yeah! Call those guys. And I'm gonna be back on Sunday, and I... I love you, you know. - Okay? - I love you. I'll see you. Okay? Yeah, it's just gonna be a couple of... a couple of days. Bye. I love you. Hello. - Hello. - How are you? Good. How are you? It's a cool pool, isn't it? Yeah, it's nice. Get any sleep? Not yet. How about you? No. Not yet. How long you staying for? I'll be in the bar for the rest of the week. Well, that's good. I'm going out with some friends later, if you wanna come... Sure. Okay. I'll see you later. - Okay. - See you. Which one is burgundy? Hold on! Hold on. You really are having a midlife crisis, huh? Really? Yeah, I was afraid of that. I kept telling myself that I just wanted to be ready in case we go to war tonight. My bathroom is messier than yours. And it's not like you're not trying. Here, will you cut the tag out for me? Sure. You're too tall. Anybody ever tell you, you may be too small? Whose is this? \"A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling\" I don't know. I have that. Did it work out for you, then? Obviously. Okay. Okay. Where's your shoes? They're over here. Where's your room key? It's in my bag. And where's your bag? It's right here. - Let's go. - Wait! There's the elevator. I gotta go. Hey! Hi! How are you? Hi, Charlie! Bob, this is Charlie Brown. Hi. Nice to meet you. How are you? Nice to meet you. - This is Bambie. - How are you, Bambie? His real name's Hayashi, but... Why do they call you Charlie Brown? Everybody say, \"He looks like Charlie Brown\". You know, Snoopy, man. Oh, I'll be right back. Bob, over here."

The kids miss me, but they're fine. It gets a whole lot more complicated when you have kids. Yeah. It's scary. It's the most terrifying day of your life the day the first one is born. Yeah. Nobody ever tells you that. Your life, as you know it, is gone. Never to return. But they learn how to walk, and they learn how to talk, and... And you want to be with them. And they turn out to be the most delightful people you will ever meet in your life. Hmm, that's nice. Where'd you grow up?
