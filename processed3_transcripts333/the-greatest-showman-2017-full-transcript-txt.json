What do you call those two girls? (BOTH LAUGHING) Hey, you partners, look who moseyed into the corral. Daddy! - PHINEAS: Come here! - Did you bring a present? - A present for what? - (LAUGHING) - For my birthday! - Your what? - My birthday. - It's not your birthday. Okay, I do have a present... but not just any present. Oh, no. The most amazing birthday present ever. This extraordinary machine was originally created by Leonardo da Vinci, 400 years ago. But the blueprints had been lost for centuries until just last week, on a stormy night, when a sunken pirate ship washed up on the shores of Nantucket. They found skeletons and treasures and the blueprints were recovered by none other than J.W. Mercantile. The blueprints crossed my desk very briefly but I managed to commit them to memory. And if I have remembered correctly... Happy birthday, Caroline. This is a wishing machine. You tell it your wishes... and it keeps them safe until they come true. Even if you forget them, they're always there. Can I tell a wish? Step right up. Go ahead. I wish to marry Santa Claus. (CHUCKLES) That is a good wish. I wish... for ballet slippers. Hey, that's» that's a good wish, too. What's your wish, Mommy? I wish... for happiness like this forever for you and you... and for your father. Boring! - (PHINEAS LAUGHS) - CHARITY (LAUGHS): Boring?

(DOOR OPENS) - Charles, we're leaving. - Huh? This bank only wants to lend money to people with money. What are you looking at, flop-doodle? Mr. Barnum. This venture you propose is risky and somewhat bizarre. It's a good bet is what it is, sir. People don't want to admit it... but they're fascinated with the exotic and the macabre.",

        "Or any job, apparently. That's what makes our life together so exciting. Charity. This isn't the life I promised you. But I have everything I want. What about the magic? What do you call those two girls?  Hey, you partners, look who moseyed into the corral. Daddy! - PHINEAS: Come here! - Did you bring a present? - A present for what? -  - For my birthday! - Your what? - My birthday. - It's not your birthday. Okay, I do have a present... but not just any present. Oh, no. The most amazing birthday present ever. This extraordinary machine was originally created by Leonardo da Vinci, 400 years ago. But the blueprints had been lost for centuries until just last week, on a stormy night, when a sunken pirate ship washed up on the shores of Nantucket. They found skeletons and treasures and the blueprints were recovered by none other than J.W. Mercantile. The blueprints crossed my desk very briefly but I managed to commit them to memory. And if I have remembered correctly... Happy birthday, Caroline. This is a wishing machine. You tell it your wishes... and it keeps them safe until they come true. Even if you forget them, they're always there. Can I tell a wish? Step right up. Go ahead. I wish to marry Santa Claus.  That is a good wish. I wish... for ballet slippers. Hey, that's» that's a good wish, too. What's your wish, Mommy? I wish... for happiness like this forever for you and you... and for your father. Boring! -  - CHARITY : Boring? Since when has happiness ever been boring? ♪ Ev'ry night I lie in bed ♪ ♪ The brightest colors fill my head ♪ ♪ A million dreams are keepin' me awake ♪ GIRLS: ♪ I think of what the world could be ♪ ♪ A vision of the one I see ♪ ♪ A million dreams is all it's gonna take ♪ PHINEAS: ♪ A million dreams ♪ ♪ For the world we're gonna make ♪ -  -  The goat prices go up, so the pork bellies go down.  - Charles, we're leaving. - Huh? This bank only wants to lend money to people with money. What are you looking at, flop-doodle? Mr. Barnum. This venture you propose is risky and somewhat bizarre. It's a good bet is what it is, sir. People don't want to admit it... but they're fascinated with the exotic and the macabre."

MAN: He's out of his element. MAN 2: What is this about? MAN 3: Is that Barnum? WOMAN: This isn't the circus. I recently had the privilege of hearing the most divine voice I've ever heard. Suddenly, he's a connoisseur. PHINEAS: Now, I know that sounds like Barnum humbug... but I have 100 bottles of good champagne on ice that says this isn't just another sideshow novelty.

Just make it very clear I expect them to afford you all the deference you deserve and that they should be nice to you anyway. LETTIE: Ain't that a sight for sore eyes?  Couldn't even say \"hello.\" Or \"goodbye.\" He's going on tour. - Sorry, guys. - Oh, pull yourself together, Carlyle. Don't you have somewhere to be? -  -   Anne Wheeler. Mr. Barnum said he left a ticket for me.  I'm-- I'm sorry. I-- I believe there's only supposed to be one. No, there's meant to be two. I wasn't sure you'd come if I asked. MAN: Five minutes to curtain. -  -  I've always wanted to go to the theater. MR. CARLYLE: Phillip, is that you? Mother. Father. This is Anne Wheeler. Phillip... have you no shame? Associating yourself with that Barnum business is one thing... but parading around with the help? Anne. Anne! Anne!  How dare you speak to her like that. You forget your place, Phillip. My Place?"
