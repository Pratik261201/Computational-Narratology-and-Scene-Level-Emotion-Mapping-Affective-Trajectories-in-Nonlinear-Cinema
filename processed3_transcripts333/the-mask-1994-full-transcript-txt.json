So what time should I pick you up? Well, see, here's the thing, my very best girlfriend just came into town and I know she would die to go to this. So could we maybe get an extra ticket for her? Ooh. They're out. They're sold out. That means there's no more. Oh, well, I just can't let her sit home all alone. Look, I'll tell you what, why don't you just go with your friend? Stanley, I couldn't do that. No, come on. - Stanley, you are the nicest guy. - Aah. - Really, you are. - Yeah? Charlie, isn't Stanley the nicest guy? The best. Oh, that was the most sickening display I've ever seen. I disagree. I think I'm wearing her down. Buddy, you know what you need? You need a little change of pace. Tonight, I'm gonna take you on a love safari, deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle. Tell me more, bwana. The Coco Bongo Club... hottest new joint in town.

You know, you're lucky you caught me, I was just on my way out to a great... Could you hold this for me, please? I will hold anything you want. Thank you. Can you help me? So... what kind of account do you have in mind? I'm not sure exactly. You see, I'm just terrible with things like that. That's an interesting tie, Mister...? Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss. Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet you. - The pleasure's all mine. - May I? - May you what? - I'm such a mess. - Oh, of course. - Thanks. That's what they're there for. As I was saying about that tie, it kinda reminds me of one of those... what do you call it? Inkblot tests. - A Rorschach test. - Right. You know, it sort of looks like, hmm... a young woman riding bareback, sort of a... Lady Godiva or something. Of course. What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss? Hmm... I... I don't know. Uh... it... bright colors. It's... it's a power tie. It's supposed to make you feel...",

He put that right in my floor, then he jumped out the window, officer! - Jumped right out the window? - Are you writing notes? This is... impossible. Those pajamas are impossible. This actually happened. Uh, see, I have, uh... an inner ear problem. - Sometimes I can't hear anything. - That a fact? Eh? Here's my card. If you remember anything unusual about last night... anything at all... call me. You betcha. Thank you. And, good luck, huh... crackin' the case. Oh my God, I'm late! Keys. Keys. Where's the keys? Damn. Milo! Get the keys. Get 'em. Find 'em. Get the keys! Ow! Jeez. I am so late. Good boy. Good boy! Come on, boy. Give them to me. Drop it! Easy! Watch that bump!

Do you know anything about the disturbance last night? Disturbance? Yeah, some kind of prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman. Attacked? You didn't hear anything? She unloaded a couple of rounds of 20-ought buckshot five feet from your door. Look at the floor! See that? He put that right in my floor, then he jumped out the window, officer! - Jumped right out the window? - Are you writing notes? This is... impossible. Those pajamas are impossible. This actually happened. Uh, see, I have, uh... an inner ear problem. - Sometimes I can't hear anything. - That a fact? Eh? Here's my card. If you remember anything unusual about last night... anything at all... call me. You betcha. Thank you. And, good luck, huh... crackin' the case. Oh my God, I'm late! Keys. Keys. Where's the keys?

Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home this Christmas. Tell Scarlet I do give a damn. Pardon me. Thank you! You love me. You really love me! You're not goin' anywhere. Drop it, Tyrell! Hey, Kellaway. Drop it! All right. So you got a warrant this time, or you just stop by for a nightcap? What I got is probable cause. Couple of your boys were spotted knocking over Edge City Bank. Easy, junior, you're giving me a woody here. And one of 'em was wearing a big green mask. You know, for once, Kellaway, you're right. Except it wasn't one of my boys. Maybe if you tried a little actual police work... - Cuff him. - Hey, Lieutenant, we got a stiff upstairs. It's one of the guys from the heist. Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours, Tyrell. You and I are going downtown for a little chat. Get him outta here! Ipkiss. Ipkiss, I know you're in there. Police! Oh my... - Open up. - Oh my God! Ipkiss, I know you're in there! Open up! Come on, I'm getting blisters on my fingers. Hey, Milo, no, no! No, no, no. No! No, no! Stop it! I'm coming! Okay, I'm coming! I'll be right there. Let's go, Ipkiss! Move it!"

You. You're losing it, Dorian. Oh, no, I'm not losing anything... except maybe some extra baggage around here. What is that supposed to mean? You know, you weren't putting up much of a fight with that freak show last night, when he tried to kiss you. Did it look like, I had much of a choice? Maybe you did... maybe you didn't. Who knows, right? I'll tell you one thing, it's going to be payback for anybody who crosses me. Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our hands here, and you stroll in over an hour late? If I have to put up with your slovenly behavior... Back off, monkey boy, before I tell your daddy you're running this place like it's your own personal piggy bank.
