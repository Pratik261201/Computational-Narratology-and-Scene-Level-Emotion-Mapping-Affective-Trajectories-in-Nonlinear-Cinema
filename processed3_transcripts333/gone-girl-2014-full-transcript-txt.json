The primal questions of any marriage. \"What are you thinking?\" \"How are you feeling?\" \"What have we done to each other?\" The Irish prince graces us with his presence. His majesty prefers not to be moistened. I got you a present. - I hated this game. - You loved it. You loved it. Thank you. I'll add it to the collection. Can you pour me a bourbon? What's up, Jitters? Well, if you're not going to talk, I'm gonna have to fill the silence... with another excruciating story by Margo Dunne. I could tell you about my recent customer service experience... - changing Internet service providers. - I like that one. Or how about the time I saw that woman who looked exactly like my friend Monica? But it wasn't Monica. It was a total stranger. Who was also named Monica. - Made it kind of interesting. - It's great. I'm just having a bad day. - Amy? - It's our anniversary. - Five years. - Five? That came fast. And furious. I'm so crazy, stupid happy. I met a boy. A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy. Excuse me, miss? I just want you to be careful... where you put down that monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer... because the party's down to three Beast Lights and a bottle of Pucker. It might attract some desperate characters. It could. I mean, the Amish are on a Rumspringa. They already relieved me of my artisanal meat platter. Finally, someone tells me how to pronounce that word. \"Meat\"? Yes, \"meat. \" One syllable. Thank you. Whose beer am I about to drink? Don't tell me. Let's see, who's your type? I don't see you sitting quietly... while he bloviates on his postgrad thesis about Proust. Uh-Oh. Ls that him? Ironic hipster, so self-aware, he makes everything a joke. I prefer men who are funny, not \"funny. \" What type are you? Corn-fed, salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy. Missouri? Cute. - Native New Yorker? - The world ends at the Hudson. What's your name? Amy. Well, Amy, who are you? A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander. B, I'm a moderately influential warlord. C, I write personality quizzes for magazines. Okay.

I don't remember the point. Deep Hasbro thoughts. Spin. What was the clue last year she got so mad about? When your poor Amy has a cold... this dessert just must be sold. The answer? I still don't know the answer, Go. - A few years ago, you'd have known. - A few years ago, it was fun. Year one, the traditional gift was paper. She got me a beautiful notebook. Told me to go write my novel. What did you get her? A kite. - She'd never flown a kite. - Okay. Anyway. Year four, flowers. She led me outside to the dying rosebush in the backyard. That's symbolic. Yeah. What's the gift for five? Wood. - So, what did you get her? - There's no good gift for wood. I know!

My sister Margo and I own The Bar downtown. Oh, The Bar. Love the name. Very meta. Thanks. Pretty things. Stay. My office, here. Beautiful dress. Date night? It's our anniversary. It's a guest bedroom, there. Cat's room on the end. I checked up here. This is the kitchen... obviously. This is my wife's office. Amy's office. Wow. Impressive gal. Yeah. Should I be concerned? I remember these. I loved these books. Wait a minute. Your wife is Amazing Amy? Yeah. She is. Wow. Amazing-fucking-Amy is getting fucking married. That's how the night started. With me, regular, flawed, real Amy, jealous, as always, of the golden child. Perfect, brilliant, Amazing Amy, who's getting fucking married. When I was 10, I quit cello. In the next book, Amazing Amy became a prodigy. Did you play volleyball? I got cut, freshman year. She made varsity. When did you have a dog? She got the dog. Puddles made her more relatable. Wow. I love your parents... but they really can be assholes. - Nick! - Sir! Hey, thanks for coming, man. No problem. Hey, sweetheart. Big night for your mom. It would mean so much if you would talk to a few reporters... bloggers, give them a little Amy color. People wanna hear from you. - We can't stay long. - Fantastic. Fifteen minutes, tops. This is why I have my brownstone. My trust fund. I know I can't complain. Your parents literally plagiarized your childhood. No, they improved upon it, and then peddled it to the masses. I thought you were gonna wear white to match the wedding theme. I thought that would be creepy. \"If it's worth doing, it's worth doing... \" Hold up! I know how this ends. Don't tell me. You're very cute, Nick. Amy, you know what would make Dad's night. I'm on it. I love having strangers pick at my scabs. I'm curious whether... it's difficult for you to see Amazing Amy heading down the aisle. And this big party celebrating this fictional wedding. Because it's my understanding you are not married. Is that correct? Correct. Amazing Amy has always been one step ahead of me. Excuse me. I'm sorry, I just have a few questions. It's you. I'm here in a strictly journalistic capacity.",

In the course of that time, you've had the opportunity... to perform such gracious gestures as... not correcting Nick when he pronounced \"quinoa\" as \"kween-o-a. \" An understandable mistake. He also thought it was a fish. He thinks Velveeta is a cheese. You also manage to appear shocked and delighted... when Nick's elderly mother breaks into an impromptu rendition... of New York, New York, every time she sees you. These bag of bone shoes. That's just frightening. You also bought Nick his very first pair of scissors. And matching stapler. Amy Elliott, you are more than amazing. You are brilliant, yet entirely un-snobby. You challenge me. You surprise me. And, fun fact for the readers... you have a world-class vagina. My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married. Is that correct? I'm not. Isn't it time we fixed that? And then... the night wasn't so bad anymore. And it's done. Crossed off the list. Now, normally, we would not treat this as a missing persons case so quick... but given the scene at your house... and given our spike in violent crime of late... we are gonna take this very, very seriously. Okay. Good. We've got forensics over at your place. You got somewhere to stay? - I could stay at my sister's. - Okay. We're tracking Amy's phone, her credit cards. We will organize searches, put up flyers. We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow. You're having a press conference? I wanna get the word out, right? Yeah, it's just all of a sudden, I feel like I'm on a Law & Order episode. Time is of the essence in these cases. But, that said, do you wanna wait and call a lawyer? Absolutely not. I just wanna help. So, you and Amy have been here two years. - You tend bar... - I own The Bar. And I teach creative writing at MVCC. - No kids? - Not yet. So, what does Amy do most days? A woman with all those degrees, what does she do? I don't know. She keeps busy. Doing what? She's a voracious reader. So, she's always got a book in her hand. Well, days can get long. I know a few housewives, that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon. Or prescription pills. Just last week, we had a soccer mom. Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in over some OxyContin.",

You also manage to appear shocked and delighted... when Nick's elderly mother breaks into an impromptu rendition... of New York, New York, every time she sees you. These bag of bone shoes. That's just frightening. You also bought Nick his very first pair of scissors. And matching stapler. Amy Elliott, you are more than amazing. You are brilliant, yet entirely un-snobby. You challenge me. You surprise me. And, fun fact for the readers... you have a world-class vagina. My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married. Is that correct? I'm not. Isn't it time we fixed that? And then... the night wasn't so bad anymore. And it's done. Crossed off the list. Now, normally, we would not treat this as a missing persons case so quick... but given the scene at your house... and given our spike in violent crime of late... we are gonna take this very, very seriously. Okay. Good. We've got forensics over at your place. You got somewhere to stay? - I could stay at my sister's. - Okay. We're tracking Amy's phone, her credit cards. We will organize searches, put up flyers. We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow. You're having a press conference? I wanna get the word out, right? Yeah, it's just all of a sudden, I feel like I'm on a Law & Order episode. Time is of the essence in these cases. But, that said, do you wanna wait and call a lawyer? Absolutely not. I just wanna help. So, you and Amy have been here two years. - You tend bar... - I own The Bar. And I teach creative writing at MVCC. - No kids? - Not yet. So, what does Amy do most days? A woman with all those degrees, what does she do? I don't know. She keeps busy. Doing what? She's a voracious reader. So, she's always got a book in her hand. Well, days can get long. I know a few housewives, that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon. Or prescription pills. Just last week, we had a soccer mom. Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in over some OxyContin."

Now I'm at the station... and the cops are at the house, and it's serious and I'm calling you. There's a lot of things that are being juggled right now. I'm standing right next to Detective Rhonda Boney... who's the lead investigator on this and she's... My mother-in-law would like to speak with you. This is Detective Boney. I wanna go home.

Hey... have you told me everything? Of course. Everything? Why would you even ask me that? Ever since you walked into The Bar that morning Amy went missing, you seem... - off. - I am off. Everybody's examining me and projecting their shit on me. All I want is to come over here, have a beer with you... and not be judged. Can we do that? Of course. You know what I keep thinking? If Mom were here? Yeah. Like I'm 12. Nick, Mom would fix it. I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep. - Love you. - Love you. So, here's a strange, new sentence. I am a Missourian. Bye, Dad. No money, no jobs, no prospects. And then, we heard from Go. Mama Maureen... Stage 4 breast cancer. So, we moved to Missouri. I don't mind. I just wish he'd asked. Nick is happy to be home. But I don't know if he's happy I'm with him. I feel like something he loaded by mistake. Something to be jettisoned, if necessary. Something disposable. I feel like I could disappear. Oh, my God! - I saw you on TV. - Okay. - It's so crazy. - Yeah, I know. - She just vanished? - She's just gone. - I've been so worried about you. - Where have you been? I called you a hundred times. You gotta pick up your phone! Rehearsals. What? Godspell. My sister's asleep in the other room. I needed to see you. I know this is a bad idea. Can you at least tell me you love me? I do love you, but we have to be really careful right now. I've been so scared. Between rehearsals? You told me I needed to have my own life. I know. We need to stop. I need you. Touch me. Stop it. Come here. Sit down. Okay. Did you, by any chance, tell anybody anything about us? Even in texting, or on Facebook. Facebook? I use the disposable phone. You buy my presents in cash. I'm not stupid, Nick. I know, sweetie. Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office? I don't know. Maybe. They better be mine. Sweetheart, think. I don't know. I'd have to check my red panty inventory. Andie, I need you to take this seriously, okay?",

Cable news is all over your shit. I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep? His wife's nowhere to be found... and here's Nick Dunne for you, flirting. Cute pic, huh? - Who is that? - Some fucking tragedy groupie. - Who the fuck is that? - I don't know. She was trying to give me a casserole. On the show today we have defense attorney, Tanner Bolt... patron saint to wife-killers everywhere. Tanner Bolt, would you actually consider defending Nick Dunne? Well, let me just say... as always, Ellen, thank you for such a warm welcome. But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne. Listen, just because this guy isn't walking around weeping... that doesn't mean that he's not hurting. Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath is a lack of empathy. But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath... to behave normally in this situation... because it's the most abnormal situation in the world. Tanner, are you trying to tell me that this photo... is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior? I'm so sick of being picked apart by women. You need to hire Tanner Bolt. I don't deserve this. Innocent until proven guilty. That's exactly what you deserve. Go home, Nick. Hey, buddy. I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy. We're not gonna arrest anybody... just because some blonde dunce says so. Why are you going so easy on him? You got a crush? One, I am conducting an investigation, not a witch-hunt. And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever. She was trying to buy a gun. We don't know who or what was scaring her, Gil. Give me the update. No drug angles panned out yet, so cross that off the list. I talked to the nurses who care for Nick's father. The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten, so cross that off the list. - Hey. - Hey. So, luminol lit up the kitchen like the 4th of July. - Whoa. - Yeah. The blood is profuse. It is Amy's, type B, and we should have DNA soon. Thoughts on a weapon? Trajectory indicates blunt force. Maybe a club or a two-by-four. She fell there, but I doubt she got back up. Amy's medical records come in? No, we'll have them later tonight. My wife says he's a killer.",

Cute pic, huh? - Who is that? - Some fucking tragedy groupie. - Who the fuck is that? - I don't know. She was trying to give me a casserole. On the show today we have defense attorney, Tanner Bolt... patron saint to wife-killers everywhere. Tanner Bolt, would you actually consider defending Nick Dunne? Well, let me just say... as always, Ellen, thank you for such a warm welcome. But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne. Listen, just because this guy isn't walking around weeping... that doesn't mean that he's not hurting. Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath is a lack of empathy. But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath... to behave normally in this situation... because it's the most abnormal situation in the world. Tanner, are you trying to tell me that this photo... is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior? I'm so sick of being picked apart by women. You need to hire Tanner Bolt. I don't deserve this. Innocent until proven guilty. That's exactly what you deserve. Go home, Nick. Hey, buddy. I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy. We're not gonna arrest anybody... just because some blonde dunce says so. Why are you going so easy on him? You got a crush? One, I am conducting an investigation, not a witch-hunt. And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever. She was trying to buy a gun. We don't know who or what was scaring her, Gil. Give me the update. No drug angles panned out yet, so cross that off the list. I talked to the nurses who care for Nick's father. The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten, so cross that off the list. - Hey. - Hey. So, luminol lit up the kitchen like the 4th of July. - Whoa. - Yeah. The blood is profuse. It is Amy's, type B, and we should have DNA soon. Thoughts on a weapon? Trajectory indicates blunt force. Maybe a club or a two-by-four. She fell there, but I doubt she got back up. Amy's medical records come in? No, we'll have them later tonight. My wife says he's a killer."

She does the treasure hunt. Now, the treasure hunt is critical. She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities. Rubbing my nose in it. And she leaves clue number one for the police... which will lead them back to my office... which is a place where Andie and I would often... And she leaves a pair of red panties. Right. Racy, looks bad. - Clue two. - My father's house. Another place where Andie and I would occasionally have relations. - Clue three? - Woodshed. - Also a location... - Oh, my God. - We had limited options. - A hotel. - Amy would have seen the credit card bill. - Put it on Andie's credit card."

We have a major shocking development in the Amazing Amy disappearance. We go live to that story now. Oh, my God. You little slut. My name is Andie Fitzgerald. I met Nicholas Dunne... when he was my creative writing teacher at Mill Valley. Why is she dressed like a babysitter? I am deeply ashamed... of having been romantically involved with a married man. The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits. I truly believed we were in love. Now, she looks like a fucking Mennonite. I know that is no excuse. No, it is not. L do not, in my heart, believe Nick Dunne would have killed for me. My prayers go out to everyone who loves Amy. I apologize for the pain this has caused them. We have loved Nick Dunne like a son. That love ended today. Come on, you're staring at ghosts. He met our trust with lie after lie. We now absolutely believe... Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter. Our Amazing Amy. This just got very exciting. We need a moment. We're gonna have to bow out of this. - Nothing has changed. - Everything has changed. An hour ago, we were ahead of this.

One, two, three, four, five. Thank you. He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist. Yeah, no kidding. Roll tape. Five... four... three... two... Seriously, I can't believe how fucking good you were. - Amy brings out the best in me. - Doni. Keep it together, you two. At least for the next 24 hours. People still hate you. Women want to scratch your eyes out. Andie was really good TV. - She's a good person. - Therein lies the problem. Ride this out... and when Sharon airs tomorrow, we'll be looking at a whole new you.

I gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over. Every time you said something stupid... I thought, \"Maybe he's just stupid. \" But I was wrong. That's what this is about. Are these the clubs you don't play golf with? None of that is mine. None of this was put here by me. Those are nice clubs. You got the makings of a real man cave. Everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good. Nick! - You can't do that! - Of course we can. Amy, it's time to move on. What can I do to help? I need some time to think. - That's the last thing you need. - Desi... Twenty years, you have kept me dangling. Finally, last night, you came to me, and you chose me. Follow that instinct. Don't trust the instinct that left you beaten and homeless... sleeping in your car, fearing for your life. I'm not gonna force myself on you. I understand what you're saying, Desi. I do. I've been so mistreated for so long. I've forgotten how to behave. I'll move in here tomorrow... and we'll work it out together. I just want you to be you again. They only took Margo to fuck with you. She's not spending another fucking second in there. I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna tell them everything. What? We tell Boney very little. Without a body, without a murder weapon... their only hope is a confession. So, you let them do all the talking. That way, we can jump-start your defense. The truth is my defense. Recognize these? Yes. It's Amy's anniversary present to me. Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick? Mommy, Daddy, baby, and that made you real mad? No. - Recognize this? - Never seen that before in my life. It's Amy's diary. We found this at your father's house. Is this your wife's handwriting? - He's not a handwriting ex... - Looks like it. Our experts thought so, too. Do you wanna play a little true or false? Sure. \"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me. \" Yeah, that's true. You thought quinoa was a fish? That is also true, yes. She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her. I hit her? No, never happened. - \"Pushed,\" it says \"pushed. \" - Absolutely not. I never touched her. She tried to buy a gun.

        "Okay. Fuck! Girlfriend's real cute, Nick. Is that what this is about? I have treated you more than fair throughout this entire investigation. I gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over. Every time you said something stupid... I thought, \"Maybe he's just stupid. \" But I was wrong. That's what this is about. Are these the clubs you don't play golf with? None of that is mine. None of this was put here by me. Those are nice clubs. You got the makings of a real man cave. Everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good. Nick! - You can't do that! - Of course we can. Amy, it's time to move on. What can I do to help? I need some time to think. - That's the last thing you need. - Desi... Twenty years, you have kept me dangling. Finally, last night, you came to me, and you chose me. Follow that instinct. Don't trust the instinct that left you beaten and homeless... sleeping in your car, fearing for your life. I'm not gonna force myself on you. I understand what you're saying, Desi. I do. I've been so mistreated for so long. I've forgotten how to behave. I'll move in here tomorrow... and we'll work it out together. I just want you to be you again. They only took Margo to fuck with you. She's not spending another fucking second in there. I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna tell them everything. What? We tell Boney very little. Without a body, without a murder weapon... their only hope is a confession. So, you let them do all the talking. That way, we can jump-start your defense. The truth is my defense. Recognize these? Yes. It's Amy's anniversary present to me. Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick? Mommy, Daddy, baby, and that made you real mad? No. - Recognize this? - Never seen that before in my life. It's Amy's diary. We found this at your father's house. Is this your wife's handwriting? - He's not a handwriting ex... - Looks like it. Our experts thought so, too. Do you wanna play a little true or false? Sure. \"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me. \" Yeah, that's true. You thought quinoa was a fish? That is also true, yes. She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her. I hit her? No, never happened. - \"Pushed,\" it says \"pushed. \" - Absolutely not. I never touched her. She tried to buy a gun. I doubt that, but I don't know."
