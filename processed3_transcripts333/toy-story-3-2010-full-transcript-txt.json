Finished! Over the hill! Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys. We all knew this day was coming. HAMM: Yeah, but now it's here. Look, every toy goes through this. No one wants to see... Hey, Sarge! What are you doing? War's over, folks. Me and the boys are moving on. - Moving on? - You're going AWOL? We done our duty. Andy's grown up. And let's face it, when the trash bags come out, we army guys are the first to go. - Trash bags? - Who said anything about trash bags? It has been an honor serving with you. Good luck, folks. You're gonna need it. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait! - (YELPS) We're getting thrown away? - No. No one's getting thrown away. MR.

Real play! I can't wait! Now, if you'll excuse us, we best be headin' back. Welcome to Sunnyside, folks. - Thank you. - Take care, pinky. - Goodbye, Mr. Lotso. Thank you. - HAMM: Thank you, buddy boy. - Will I see you again? - Oh, I'll see you tonight in my dreams. Ken, let's get a move on. Barbie, come with me. Live in my dream house. I know it's crazy. I know we just met. Heck, you don't know me from G.I. Joe, but when I look at you, I feel like we were... - Made for each other. - ...made for each other.  - Yay! - Yes. - LOTSO: Ken? - Coming, Lotso.  BARBIE: This is so exciting!   HAMM: Sounds like kids to me. Oh, I want to get played with. Why can't time go faster? How many you reckon are out there? MRS. POTATO HEAD: They sound so sweet.  Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit. But we need to go home. We can have a whole new life here, Woody."
