Okay, peace! Peace! Peace! I'm looking for an actress... ...an actress to play a mother. Old ladies like you... When you see movie stars on TV- - you must dream of becoming one. - No, I don't. - Why not? - You have nothing else to do. - No, I'm busy. These women won't agree to play communists like this. It might work if we invite them to your house first... But if we ask them right here, they'll be afraid. People might think they really are communists. I disagree... In my neighborhood everybody would do it. Then let's go there instead. It's impossible here. This whole area was communist. We're looking for women with children - -to play communist wives. You try to prevent us from burning down your house. But in the end we burn it down. 'Mother, they burned our house down!' Like that. And don't worry if you touch her breasts. You're still a kid. Ready? Kill them! No! - Destroy their house! - No, please don't! Burn it! Kill! Cry! Weep! Don't burn my house. Keep crying! Okay cut, cut! Whether this ends up on the big screen - - or only on TV it doesn't matter. - But we have to show... - That this is the history! This is who we are! So in the future people will remember! It doesn't have to be a big film - - like Rank Organization, Paramount Pictures, MGM... We, in our simple way step by step - - will tell the story- - of what we did when we were young! Excuse me... There's many ghosts here, because many people were killed here. - They died unnatural deaths. - Unnatural deaths. They arrived perfectly healthy. When they got here they were beaten up... and died. At first, we beat them to death... But there was too much blood. There was so much blood here... So when we cleaned it up, it smelled awful. To avoid the blood, I used this system. Can I show you? Sit there. Face that way. We have to re-enact this properly. This is how to do it - - without too much blood. I've tried to forget all this with good music... Dancing... Feeling happy.. A little alcohol... A little marijuana... A little... what do you call it? Ecstasy.. Once I'd get drunk, I'd 'fly' and feel happy. Cha cha.",

When I was in high school - - I was the only one not scared of him - - because I didn't think of him as a big gangster. But when people heard his name, they'd be terrified. - Why? - Because he's one of the killers. Now, the communists' children are starting to speak out - - trying to reverse the history. One of them wrote, 'I’m Proud to be the Child of a Communist.' But this won't last long - - because the people won't accept it. Communism will never be accepted here, because - - we have so many gangsters, and that's a good thing. The word 'gangster' comes from English. 'Free men'. Thugs want freedom to do things, even if they're wrong... But if we know how to work with them - - all we have to do is direct them. We were gangsters. We didn't have real jobs. So we'd do anything for money.. ...just to buy nice clothes. This was the cinema - - where I worked. I'd stand here, scalping tickets and showing off. When films were popular, we'd scalp tickets. But when the communists were strong - - they demanded a ban on American films. They wanted fewer American films. - So we gangsters made less money. - Because there was no audience. Hollywood films were popular. Without them the gangsters didn't make as much money. As we say: 'Dinner missed the belly' When we'd watch happy movies, like Elvis movies - - we'd leave the cinema smiling, dancing to the music. Our hands... Still dancing... Still in the mood of the film... if girls passed, we'd whistle. We loved it. We didn't care what people thought. Here was the paramilitary office, where I always killed people. I'd see the guy being interrogated... I'd give him a cigarette. I'd still be dancing, laughing... it was like we were killing... ...happily! When my mom was alive - - sometimes, when I was screaming... ...my mom would rush in and wake me up. 'Before you sleep, wash your feet!' 'Pray properly Don't just sleep.' I know my bad dreams come from what I did... ...killing people who didn't want to die. I forced them to die.",

You interrogated communists in your newsroom? He was always gathering information. When he had the information - - he'd say: 'Guilty!' and we'd take them away and kill them. When you interrogated communists in your office - - what questions did you ask? Whatever we asked, we'd change their answers - - to make them look bad. As a newspaper man - - my job was to make the public hate them. And your relationship with the army? - The army. - We had no formal relationship. But after we captured the communist youth - - and beat them to a pulp - - we gave them to the army but the army wouldn't take them. They said, 'Just dump them in the river.' Do you remember exactly what the army said? I didn't bring the victims. I had men for that. Why would I do such grunt work? Why would I kill people? I didn't have to! One wink from me and they're dead! Pancasila Youth! How you doing, Anwar? This is the real Anwar Congo! Pancasila Youth, servants of the nation... Once our sails go up - - we never turn back! - Pancasila! - Forever! All Pancasila Youth members are heroes. From exterminating the communists - - to fighting neo-communists and left-wing extremists- - and those who want to destroy our country.. This isn't only the duty of the army and police. We, Pancasila Youth, must take a stand. These are threats to the nation, and we must take action. They say Pancasila Youth is a gangster organization. If we're gangsters- - I'm the biggest gangster of all. Oh, shit! How did Pancasila Youth exterminate the communists? We killed them all. That's what happened. May I hit the ball now? We have too much democracy it's chaos. What is this 'democracy'? Things were better under the military dictatorship. Better economy More security . Gangsters are free men.

It matches your body shape. It's perfect! - This one's for the 'Big Boss'. - Yep. It's perfect for me. And you know where I got the inspiration for it? I always watched gangsterfilms - - where they always kill with wire. It's faster with wire. Because when you pull the wire hard, the victim can't grab it... He can't, because it cuts in... it's great to be a communist, huh? Don't just nod. Say 'Yes sir!' - Wanna smoke, Pang? - No. Try this 'neo-colonialist' cigar. Have a puff. Just stick it in your nose if you don't want to smoke it. - Look at him! - Look at me. Look him in the eye! Hold on, Joshua. It's evening prayers. - Don't tie the blindfold so tight. - I didn't. The way I pull it just looks tight. Even by the window it's hot. 'Human rights!' All this talk about 'human rights' pisses me off. 'We want a little human rights!' Back then there was no human rights. - Because you made a revolution. - That's no excuse. For example, in Argentina some generals launch a coup d'état- - and then they're convicted of human rights violations.",

It matches your body shape. It's perfect! - This one's for the 'Big Boss'. - Yep. It's perfect for me. And you know where I got the inspiration for it? I always watched gangsterfilms - - where they always kill with wire. It's faster with wire. Because when you pull the wire hard, the victim can't grab it... He can't, because it cuts in... it's great to be a communist, huh? Don't just nod. Say 'Yes sir!' - Wanna smoke, Pang? - No. Try this 'neo-colonialist' cigar. Have a puff. Just stick it in your nose if you don't want to smoke it. - Look at him! - Look at me. Look him in the eye! Hold on, Joshua. It's evening prayers. - Don't tie the blindfold so tight. - I didn't. The way I pull it just looks tight. Even by the window it's hot. 'Human rights!' All this talk about 'human rights' pisses me off. 'We want a little human rights!' Back then there was no human rights. - Because you made a revolution. - That's no excuse. For example, in Argentina some generals launch a coup d'état- - and then they're convicted of human rights violations."

All along Sudirman Street - - I killed every Chinese person I met. I stabbed them! I don't remember how many but it was dozens. If I met them, I stabbed them. All the way to Asia Street, where I met my girlfriend's dad. Remember my girlfriend was Chinese? 'Crush the Chinese' became 'Crush my Girlfriend's Dad'! So I stabbed him, too! Because he was Chinese! He fell into a ditch. I hit him with a brick. He sank. Killing is the worst crime you can do. So the key is to find a way - - not to feel guilty it's all about finding the right excuse. For example, if I'm asked to kill someone... If the compensation is right... ...then of course I'll do it, and from one perspective it's not wrong. That’s the perspective we must make ourselves believe. At first, I was scared... These are top gangsters! Like you and Anwar... Terrifying! And making a film! It's shocking! But if you want a true story I have one. Tell us. Because everything in this film should be true. There was a shopkeeper. He was the only Chinese person in the area. To be honest, he was my stepfather. He was my stepfather.. But although he was my stepfather- - I lived with him since I was a baby.. At 3 AM, someone knocked on our door. They called my dad. Mom said, 'It's dangerous! Don't go out.' But he went out. We heard him shout, 'Help!' Then, silence. They took him away We couldn't sleep until morning. - How old were you? - 11 or 12... I remember it well. And it's impossible to forget! We found his body under an oil drum. The drum was cut in half- - and the body was under it, like this... His head and feet were covered by sacks - - but one foot poked out like this. That same morning, nobody dared help us... We buried him like a goat next to the main road. Just me and my grandfather carrying the body- - digging the grave... No one helped us. I was so small. Then, all the communist families were exiled... We were dumped in a shantytown at the edge of the jungle. That's why to be honest, I've never been to school. I had to teach myself to read and write. Why should I hide this from you? I promise I'm not criticizing what we're doing.",

Be quiet! I've almost got it! - OK, but don't make a fist. - You're ruining the sound! - But... - Stop it! Be quiet! You're a real pain! Just shut up! Long live the Businessmen and Workers Party! I am Herman... ...ready to fight for workers' rights. Remember to vote for me on election day! If I get elected and get on the Building Commission - - I can get money from everyone. For example, if a building is 10 cm too small... I can demand 'Tear down the building!'. They'll say, 'Please don't report us. Here's your money'. Even if nothing's wrong with the building - - if I threaten them, they'll give me money anyway. Not just a little money In a block of 10 buildings... if each pays $10000, just do the math! That's already $100,000. That's only one neighborhood! Actually parliament should bethe most noble place in society. But if we see what they do there... They're really just robbers with ties. What illegal businesses are Pancasila Youth involved in? Gambling. Gambling, night clubs. Supermarkets. But that’s not illegal. They just hire us as security. - The illegal ones? - Gambling. - Any others? - Smuggling. Illegal fishing, illegal logging, illegal gambling... ...and if they don't pay we blackmail them. Let's welcome our candidate, Marzuki! Long live our party! Pancasila! Ready! What am I supposed to say? How does it begin? - What's the first sentence? - I'm Herman. - I'm Herman! - Stand up, you'll look better. Ladies and gentlemen... What comes next? I can't remember I'm Herman, from the Businessmen and Workers' Party! - Any free T-shirts? - Nope... Ma'am, here's my card. T-shirts! We want presents! Don't worry about money or presents. We'll come back with gifts. Pray for us, hopefully he'll win. Tell people who ask for presents... 'We'll come back with gifts if we win.'

        "I like this... Eye candy. This is healthy for a guy like me. Enjoy the scenery Ma'am. Okay. - One, two, three. - Ah! - Again! One, two, three. - Ah! I was asked to run for parliament. 'Why me?' 'Don't worry! You can do it!' they said. Then I thought, 'Why not?'. In fact, I'm a perfect candidate because I'm well known! Don't clench your fist. Be quiet! I've almost got it! - OK, but don't make a fist. - You're ruining the sound! - But... - Stop it! Be quiet! You're a real pain! Just shut up! Long live the Businessmen and Workers Party! I am Herman... ...ready to fight for workers' rights. Remember to vote for me on election day! If I get elected and get on the Building Commission - - I can get money from everyone. For example, if a building is 10 cm too small... I can demand 'Tear down the building!'. They'll say, 'Please don't report us. Here's your money'. Even if nothing's wrong with the building - - if I threaten them, they'll give me money anyway. Not just a little money In a block of 10 buildings... if each pays $10000, just do the math! That's already $100,000. That's only one neighborhood! Actually parliament should bethe most noble place in society. But if we see what they do there... They're really just robbers with ties. What illegal businesses are Pancasila Youth involved in? Gambling. Gambling, night clubs. Supermarkets. But that’s not illegal. They just hire us as security. - The illegal ones? - Gambling. - Any others? - Smuggling. Illegal fishing, illegal logging, illegal gambling... ...and if they don't pay we blackmail them. Let's welcome our candidate, Marzuki! Long live our party! Pancasila! Ready! What am I supposed to say? How does it begin? - What's the first sentence? - I'm Herman. - I'm Herman! - Stand up, you'll look better. Ladies and gentlemen... What comes next? I can't remember I'm Herman, from the Businessmen and Workers' Party! - Any free T-shirts? - Nope... Ma'am, here's my card. T-shirts! We want presents! Don't worry about money or presents. We'll come back with gifts. Pray for us, hopefully he'll win. Tell people who ask for presents... 'We'll come back with gifts if we win.' Tell them, 'We're filming today' - Don't forget. - Just a card? Where's 'the bonus'? Don't we get anything else? - 'The bonus' comes later."
