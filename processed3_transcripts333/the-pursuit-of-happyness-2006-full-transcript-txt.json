Well, you know you're only getting a couple of things, right? Yeah, I know. Just to look at and study, so I can choose better. Okay, well, that's smart. Yeah, make a list. Can you spell everything you're thinking of? I think so. All right. That's good. How you doing in here, man? Okay. Can we go to the park today? After? Um. No, I gotta go to Oakland. Well, uh... maybe. We'll see. Give me a kiss. I'll talk to you later. Excuse me. Oh. Excuse me, uh... when is, uh, somebody gonna clean this off? And... And... And the Y? The Y. We talked about this. It's an I in \"happiness.\" There's no Y in \"happiness.\" It's an I. I'm Chris Gardner. I met my father for the first time when I was 28 years old. And I made up my mind as a young kid that when I had children, my children were gonna know who their father was. This is part of my life story. This part is called \"Riding the Bus.\" What's that? It's a time machine, isn't it? Seems like a time machine. That seems like a time machine. It's a time machine. Take me with you. This machine... This machine on my lap... This guy, he has a time machine. He... He... He travels. He travels in the past with this machine and... it is not a time machine. It's a portable bone-density scanner. A medical device I sell for a living. Thank you for the opportunity to... To discuss it with you. I appreciate it. We just don't need it, Chris. It's unnecessary. And expensive. Well, maybe next... Thank you. It gave a slightly denser picture than an x-ray... for twice the money. - Hey. - Hey, baby. What happened? Uh... No, nothing. Look, I can't get Christopher today. Oh, no, you don't, Chris. I need... I'm back on at 7. I know. I have got to go to Oakland. So I gotta get Christopher home, feed him, bathe him, get him in bed, and be back here by 7? Yes. And we got the tax bill notice today. What are you gonna do about that? Look. This is what we gotta do. You see that car? The one with the pretty yellow shoe on it? That's mine. There's no parking near hospitals. That's what happens when you're always in a rush. Thanks anyway. Uh, very much. Uh... Uh, maybe next quarter. It's possible. I needed to sell at least two scanners a month for rent and daycare.",

She didn't know. What are you supposed to do with it? Make every side the same color. Did you pay the taxes? No, I'm gonna have to, uh, file an extension. You already filed an extension.

All right, just relax. Okay? Now, come here. Calm down. I have to go back to work. Let's get ready for bed. Hey, uh, put your plate in the sink. A few days ago I was presented with a report I'd asked for. A comprehensive audit, if you will, of our economic condition. You won't like it. I didn't like it. But we have to face the truth and then go to work to turn things around. And make no mistake about it... we can turn them around. The federal budget is out of control. And we face runaway deficits of almost $80 billion for this budget year that ends September 30th. That deficit is larger than the entire federal budget in 1957. And so is the almost $80 billion we will pay in interest this year on the national debt. Twenty years ago, in 1960, our federal government payroll was less than $13 billion. Today it is 75 billion. During these 20 years, our population has only increased by 23.3 percent... Woo! Man. I got two questions for you: What do you do? And how do you do it? I'm a stockbroker. Stockbroker. Oh, goodness. Had to go to college to be a stockbroker, huh? You don't have to. Had to be good with numbers and good with people. That's it. Hey, you take care. Hey. I'm gonna let you hang on to my car for the weekend. But I need it back for Monday. Feed the meter. I still remember that moment. They all looked so... damn happy to me. Why couldn't I look like that? I'm gonna try to get home by 6. I'm, uh, gonna stop by a brokerage firm after work. For what? I wanna see about a job there. Yeah? What job? Uh, you know, when I...

I've been pulling double shifts for... For four months now, Chris. Just... Just sell what's in your contract. Get us out of that business. Linda. That is what I am trying to do.

I'll give you more money when I come back out. Okay. Um, it's not valuable. You can't sell it anywhere. Um, I-I can't even sell it, and it's my job. Chris? Yes. Tim Brophy, Resources. How are you? Come with me. Yes, sir. Let me see if I can find you an application for our internship. I'm afraid that's all we can do for you. See, this is a satellite office. Jay Twistle in the main office, he oversees Witter Resources. I mean, I'm... You know, I'm just this office. As you can see, we got a hell of a lot of applications here... Normally I have a resume sheet, but I can't seem to find it anywhere. W-we, uh... Uh... Um... Thank you very much. I need to go. Um... I'll... I'll br... I'll bring this back. Thank you. Okay. Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner. Why did I do that? Excuse me. Excuse me. Like I said, this part of my life is called \"Being Stupid.\" Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't move! Don't move! Stay...! Stop! Stop! Don't move! Stop this...! Stop the train! Stop! Stop! The program took just 20 people every six months. One got the job. There were three blank lines after \"high school\" to... list more education. I didn't need that many lines. Try and sleep. It's late.

This is as far as I've gotten on mine. As you can see, I still have a long way to go. This is Jim Finnerty reporting for KJSF in Richmond. Hey. Wake up. Eat. Bye, Mom. Bye, baby. Come back without that, please. Oh. Yeah, I'm going to. So go ahead, say goodbye to it, 'cause I'm coming back without it. Goodbye and good riddance. You ain't had to add the \"good riddance\" part. Bye, Mom. Bye. It's written as P-P-Y, but it's supposed to be an I in \"happiness.\" Is it an adjective? Uh, no. Actually, it's a noun. But it's not spelled right. Is \"fuck\" spelled right? Yeah, that's spelled right. But that's not part of the motto, so you're not supposed to learn that. That's an adult word to show anger and, um... other things. But just don't... Don't use that one, okay? Okay. What's that say on the back of your bag? My nickname. We pick nicknames. Oh, yeah? What's it say? \"Hot Rod.\" Did you have a nickname? Yep. What? \"Ten-Gallon Head.\" Heh-heh. What's that? I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas. So everybody wears cowboy hats. And a... A ten-gallon's a big hat. I was smart back then, so they called me Ten-Gallon Head. Hoss wears that hat. Hoss? Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza. How do you know Bonanza? We watch it at Mrs. Chu's. You watch Bonanza at daycare? Yeah. When? When do...? When do you watch it? After snack? After your nap? After Love Boat. I made my list for my birthday. Yeah, what'd you...? What did you put on there? A basketball... or an ant farm. He says he's been watching TV. Oh, little TV for history. Love Boat? For history. Navy. That's... That's not the Navy. I mean, he... He could watch television at home.

Come back without that, please. Oh. Yeah, I'm going to. So go ahead, say goodbye to it, 'cause I'm coming back without it. Goodbye and good riddance. You ain't had to add the \"good riddance\" part. Bye, Mom. Bye. It's written as P-P-Y, but it's supposed to be an I in \"happiness.\" Is it an adjective? Uh, no. Actually, it's a noun. But it's not spelled right. Is \"fuck\" spelled right? Yeah, that's spelled right. But that's not part of the motto, so you're not supposed to learn that. That's an adult word to show anger and, um... other things. But just don't... Don't use that one, okay? Okay. What's that say on the back of your bag? My nickname. We pick nicknames. Oh, yeah? What's it say? \"Hot Rod.\" Did you have a nickname? Yep. What? \"Ten-Gallon Head.\" Heh-heh. What's that? I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas. So everybody wears cowboy hats. And a... A ten-gallon's a big hat. I was smart back then, so they called me Ten-Gallon Head. Hoss wears that hat. Hoss? Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza. How do you know Bonanza? We watch it at Mrs. Chu's. You watch Bonanza at daycare? Yeah. When? When do...? When do you watch it? After snack? After your nap? After Love Boat. I made my list for my birthday. Yeah, what'd you...? What did you put on there?
