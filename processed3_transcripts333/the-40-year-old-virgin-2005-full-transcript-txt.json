See you then. I'll bring a soda. Hey, enjoy your orange. Okay, take care. See you. Bye-bye. That guy needs to get laid. Tell me something I don't know. Good morning. Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry. Excuse me. Thank you. Good morning. Hey. Good morning, Paula. Andy. Excuse me. I have a question. What is the difference between Hi8 and Digital video tapes? I'm not a salesman, so, I could probably... Welcome to Smart Tech. How can I be of service to you? Well, I was just wondering what is the difference between these? Well, if I'm photographing someone as fine as yourself I'd probably go Digital. Hey, don't worry I've been lied to My God. Sorry I'm late, man. No problem. Oh, man. I had a weekend. Yeah? We went to Tijuana, Mexico, you know, and we thought it would be fun, you know, to go to this show. Everyone's, \"You gotta check out one of these shows. \" And, you know, it's a woman fucking a horse. We get there, and, you know, we think it's gonna be awesome and it is not as cool as it sounds like it would be, man. It's kind of gross. Yeah. You think, \"A woman fucking a horse\" and you get there and it's a woman fucking a horse. Yeah. It was really giving it to her. And you know what, to be honest, I felt bad for her. We all just felt bad for her. Yeah. Kind of felt bad for the horse. Wow, that's something. So what did you get up to? You know, I just kind of hung out. I was... God, Friday, when I went home I really wanted an egg-salad sandwich. And I was just obsessing about it and I was like, \"Man, I'm gonna make one of those. \" So Saturday I went out and I got, like, a dozen eggs and I boiled them all and then I just, I spent, I don't know, probably three hours, like, three-and-a-half hours making, you know, the mayonnaise and the onions and paprika and, you know, all the accoutrement. And then, by the time I was done I just really didn't feel like eating it. I can imagine. And I didn't have any bread. So, you know, it was pretty good. It was a good weekend. Sounds pretty awesome. Yeah, it was fine. Sounds really fun. Cool. Cool. Cool, cool. Hey, Paula. Yeah. I gotta tell you something.",

David, what do you suggest we play? I don't care. Anything. I would rather watch Beautician and the Beast. I would rather listen to Fran Drescher for eight hours than have to listen to Michael McDonald. Nothing against him, but if I hear Yah Mo B There one more time I'm gonna yah mo burn this place to the ground. You're such a smart ass. Get back on the floor. Fuck you. This is a great TV. Nothing beats a plasma. What are you doing? That's my customer. It certainly is not. When I came upon her, she was unattended. No, that's my... Wait. Go to the checkout there. Pick up there, please. She was unattended because I went to the back to get the brochure that she requested. I apologize, but it's too late. The transaction has been completed. Then you're gonna give me half the commission. You'll receive none of the commission. I need to talk to Paula. This is crazy. This is bullshit. Every time I make a sale, you go crying to Paula. How about Jesse Jackson? Old Jesse needs a cause. Sick of you poaching my customers. I'm sick of your crybaby bullshit. You wanna take this shit outside? Just take it outside and squash it? Let's stay inside, so everybody can see what a pussy you have, okay? Because when I remove the blade I keep in my boot from its sheath, I can't return it until it has spilled blood. Look, listen to me. You are fucking with the wrong nigger. Hey! You're fucking with the wrong sand-nigger, okay? Dude, I will hang your old ass by your turban. Turban now? Do you see any fucking turban here? Do I talk like a turban guy? Do I say, \"Hey, Jay, do you want a Slurpee? You want a Slurpee?\" Fuck you, okay? I was born in Brooklyn. Brooklyn, okay? My accent is a fucking Brooklyn accent, okay? Okay? All right, man. Calm down, dude. Look, you still covering my shift on Friday or what? If I can keep this commission, with pleasure. Cool, then.

You know, sometimes, Amy and I would make love till it was almost like we weren't two people but we were two spirits or something. Our souls were connected in this way, I can't describe it. Time stood still. It was like we were sharing the same heart. Stop, man! Why do you always come and kill the vibe with those things? \"Sharing the same heart,\" that's like some Britney Spears shit, man. This is three grown ass men, don't nobody want to hear that shit. Yeah, man, come on, nobody wants to hear that shit. Thank you, Andy. Dude, you broke up two years ago. You get over it at some point. Two years, man. You need to get past that because no ass is worth thinking that much about I always say. Andy, do me a favor. Would you please help him redeem himself by telling a real sex story? Yes. I don't... You know what, I'm a gentleman and I don't... I don't kiss and tell. Fuck it, I raise you. Nastiest shit you've ever done. I'm talking about nasty. Wow. So many stories are running through my head right now. I dated this girl for a while, and she was really a nasty freak. She just loved to get down with sex all the time. She was like, any time of day, she was like, \"Yeah, let's go. I'm so nasty. \" And I'd be nailing her. Oh, shit. She'd be like, \"Oh, you're nailing me. Cool. \" She talk dirty to you? She loved to dirty-talk. Totally into it. She'd be like, \"Yeah, let's screw, let's... I wanna fuck. \" God, it was so dirty. She'd be like, \"Me so horny, me love you long time. \" So... So what were the titties like? Yeah, describe her... Yeah, she had great tits. No, I mean, like, detailed. Did she have, like, you know, them little pink teeny nipples. Oh, yeah. Or like the long National Geograqhic nipples. You have like the bumpy Braille nipples, the Stevie Wonders. Yeah, they were nice. You know, when you, like, you grab a woman's breast and it's... And you feel it and it feels like a bag of sand when you're touching it. Bag of sand? You know what I mean. Why don't we just play?",

You know, sometimes, Amy and I would make love till it was almost like we weren't two people but we were two spirits or something. Our souls were connected in this way, I can't describe it. Time stood still. It was like we were sharing the same heart. Stop, man! Why do you always come and kill the vibe with those things? \"Sharing the same heart,\" that's like some Britney Spears shit, man. This is three grown ass men, don't nobody want to hear that shit. Yeah, man, come on, nobody wants to hear that shit. Thank you, Andy. Dude, you broke up two years ago. You get over it at some point. Two years, man. You need to get past that because no ass is worth thinking that much about I always say. Andy, do me a favor. Would you please help him redeem himself by telling a real sex story? Yes. I don't... You know what, I'm a gentleman and I don't... I don't kiss and tell. Fuck it, I raise you. Nastiest shit you've ever done. I'm talking about nasty. Wow. So many stories are running through my head right now. I dated this girl for a while, and she was really a nasty freak. She just loved to get down with sex all the time. She was like, any time of day, she was like, \"Yeah, let's go. I'm so nasty. \" And I'd be nailing her. Oh, shit. She'd be like, \"Oh, you're nailing me. Cool. \" She talk dirty to you? She loved to dirty-talk. Totally into it. She'd be like, \"Yeah, let's screw, let's... I wanna fuck. \" God, it was so dirty. She'd be like, \"Me so horny, me love you long time. \" So... So what were the titties like? Yeah, describe her... Yeah, she had great tits. No, I mean, like, detailed. Did she have, like, you know, them little pink teeny nipples. Oh, yeah. Or like the long National Geograqhic nipples. You have like the bumpy Braille nipples, the Stevie Wonders. Yeah, they were nice. You know, when you, like, you grab a woman's breast and it's... And you feel it and it feels like a bag of sand when you're touching it. Bag of sand? You know what I mean. Why don't we just play?"

Yeah, they're not in my mouth. You know, I kind of like the woman from the eBay store. That's great, but you're not gonna get with anyone unless you play the odds on this, man. You need to plant a lot of seeds. It's like this. When I was growing pot, I realized that the more seeds I planted... Thank you. ...the more pot I could ultimately smoke. I think I have all the advice that I can handle right now. Don't get bitter. I'm not bitter. I almost lost a nipple, okay? That was Jay's idea, okay? And I wasn't going to say anything, but waxing your chest is like the gayest thing you could possibly do, okay? Look at me. Looks are not important. Really look at me. I am ugly as fuck by traditional standards but I get with women. Aren't you curious as to how that's possible? I am not ugly as fuck. I didn't say you were ugly as... Well, you implied it. Okay. It doesn't matter if you're ugly as fuck or you're ugly as shit. It's about talking to women, and I know how to do that because I observe, because I am a novelist. What? You never told me that before. That's because I am not an arrogant prick, Andy. Okay? The problem most men have is they don't know how to talk to women.",

Within one hour, you'll each have 20 dates. Don't... Please don't do this. I saw this on Primetime Live. All right, ninja master. We've given you all the advice we have to give. Now you gonna put it in action. Advice? You guys all gave me different advice. He thinks you're a pothead. I am. Dude. Hey, partner. What are you whining about? You asked for this shit. No, I didn't.

That's one thing people do when they have an erection. Yeah, that's not an option. I don't have sex. Okay, well, then you can m asturbate. I'd rather not masturbate. If you'd like the erection to go away, you can light a m atch, blow out the flame and put the hot em ber on your wrist. And that will focus the brain elsewhere and you will lose your erection. Really? That'd work? Take your finger and flick your testicle and if you do that till it hurts your erection will go away. Okay, all right. It sounds unpleasant and it is. It is a trick we use in India. Okay, those are all good pieces of advice. I really appreciate it. We appreciate your business. Oh, no. We didn't get your business... No, not this time. I guess I didn't need you this time. Thank you. My goodness, Andy, you are a terrific salesman. Thank you. Gosh, you really got it down. Thanks. And your numbers are good. Thanks. I'm going to put you out on the floor full time. Really? Yeah. Wow. Okay. Good. We're gonna get you a blue shirt and tie, all right? Great. Thanks.

It's hard to tell what actually constitutes a date, though. Three to go. So that means you're gonna have sex in three days. Maybe, I might try to space them out a little bit. I'll pray for your cock.
