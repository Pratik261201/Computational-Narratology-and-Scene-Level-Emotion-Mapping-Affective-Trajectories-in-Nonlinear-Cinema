Yeah, he was coming in from Oakland. He was late, of course. Then I took him... And then, he took me to some lawyer bar. A lawyer bar? Yeah. A lawyer bar, kind of. Yeah. I don't know. Everybody there seemed like a lawyer. I felt like I was the only person without a tie. Well, maybe we should get you a tie for emergencies. Yeah, wardrobe emergencies. Yeah. Anyhow, we tried to take the freeway and... Ke... Kevin? I can barely hear you. Is that better? Not much. Where are you? Are you there yet? Yeah, I... I'm just pulling up right now. I just got here. Um... Yeah. I'm right here. I... You know what? I need to parallel park and I'm not on my earpiece. Okay. Are you good? Yeah. You know, we should talk about, you know... Maybe we can talk about, you know, that little problem before we get into the party. Okay. Is it something we should talk about now, or... Hello? Kevin? I lost you. Oh. Baby? You gotta be kidding me. I think olive oil would be good. A little more maybe? - A drizzle. - A little more. - Is this turning you on? - That is hot. See how you're slipping? This is... - It's... It's the bread, babe. - It's the two of you with the knives that... I have not had carbs for a week. I've been on this... this \"cleanse.\" How long have you been cleansing for? About 21 days. I had my juice and my smoothie earlier today... and I do feel very, you know... - Cleansed? Open? - A little faint maybe? But I'm gonna eat, I'm gonna drink and have a good time. Hi. - Hey. - How are you guys? Nice to see you. - Bend down to my level, please. - I know. So, I just had Kevin on the phone and this happened. It cracked. As I was talking to him. - You dropped it. - Our connection... No, I didn't drop it. It just cracked as I was holding it. Do you have insurance? I... I actually don't know if I do. Do you have the Skype app I showed you? No, I think it's fine. He just said he wanted to talk about something, But on the news, you know, they're talking about the comet. - Yeah. - The Miller's Comet. And they keep telling people that this can happen. Yeah. I don't think it's the comet. If you have Skype, it uses the home Wi-Fi.",

I remember at my school, we all had to, like, reenact Halley's Comet. So, they assigned each of us something celestial to do. My sister got to be Halley's Comet. I was very jealous. I've never met your sister. Have you guys met her sister? There's a picture of her right over there on the mantel, but... - She's only a fleeting comet. - she looks a little ridiculous. - That's your sister? - But why did you put it... It's the door to nowhere. In feng shui, a useless door, which this is obviously a useless door, you put a picture of someone... you have unresolved issues with... and it causes all of this weird energy flow. I don't even like being over here. - It's freaky. - You shouldn't be over there then. - Every time you're... - I'm sort of an empath. - Sort of an empath. - And I can feel it. It's like a vortex. When was the last time we were all together like this? I was thinking, right before Thanksgiving, most of us were there, but not everybody could be. I don't think Laurie... Laura? - Laurie. - Laurie. Sorry. We're gonna tell all these stories. We do that when we get together. So Laurie, what are you doing these days? - Well, I'm... - Keeping yourself busy? I'm keeping busy. I'm actually working with some outreach programs in Silicon Valley. We work with at-risk youth. Oh, wow. Didn't you... No, no, no. Are you still teaching the yoga? The Spanish Yoga? The Spoga? - No. Not me. - Are you sure that... Oh, that must've been another girl... that Kevin dated that Amir is hooking up with. Wow. Let's give him a shovel. What are you doing? What do you do for a living? I act. Shut up, guys. I didn't remember you were an actor. - So, you do mainly theater? - Well, I did. Since I moved down here to support my wife and her Skyping career. Um, but, no, I was in a TV show for about four years. - Yeah? What was that? - It was called Roswell. Oh, my God. I love Roswell. When were you on Roswell? What episodes were you on? I was on all shows. Produced. - What do you mean? - I was a series regular on that show. Yeah, he was, like, the main guy. What character did you play? - Joe. - Did you have different hair, or something?",

        "- It's just the Finnish. - The Finns. The Finns or Finnish? - You guys remember Halley's Comet? - Yes. I mean, it was such a big deal. I remember at my school, we all had to, like, reenact Halley's Comet. So, they assigned each of us something celestial to do. My sister got to be Halley's Comet. I was very jealous. I've never met your sister. Have you guys met her sister? There's a picture of her right over there on the mantel, but... - She's only a fleeting comet. - she looks a little ridiculous. - That's your sister? - But why did you put it... It's the door to nowhere. In feng shui, a useless door, which this is obviously a useless door, you put a picture of someone... you have unresolved issues with... and it causes all of this weird energy flow. I don't even like being over here. - It's freaky. - You shouldn't be over there then. - Every time you're... - I'm sort of an empath. - Sort of an empath. - And I can feel it. It's like a vortex. When was the last time we were all together like this? I was thinking, right before Thanksgiving, most of us were there, but not everybody could be. I don't think Laurie... Laura? - Laurie. - Laurie. Sorry. We're gonna tell all these stories. We do that when we get together. So Laurie, what are you doing these days? - Well, I'm... - Keeping yourself busy? I'm keeping busy.

That would make sense if they were off the grid. I'm actually thinking of... of going over there. What? - No, you're not going over there. - Honey, it's okay. - It's o... - It's ridiculous. It's not that far. Look, look, look, look. My brother, he says... he said that if... if anything strange were to happen... while the comet was passing over... - that we should stay inside. - What?

So, regular physics would say that it's one or the other. That the cat is either alive or dead. But Brian would argue that quantum physics says... that both realities exist simultaneously. It's only when you open the box that they collapse... into a single event. Right? So, listen to this. This is what he's written. \"There is another theory: that two states continue to exist... separate and decoherent from each other, each creating a new branch of reality... based on the two outcomes. Quantum decoherence ensures that the different outcomes... have no interaction with each other.\" - Hold on. - Well, that explains it. So we're in the box. We're the cat. We're both alive and dead. So, there are... There are two separate realities, and... presumably until the comet passes. - Until the comet passes? - Okay. Or decoherence is maintained and those two separate realities... will remain separate once the comet passes. Everybody will be fine. Decoherence keeps us separate. Right. Why are the other us contacting us then in this way? They didn't want to. Who got the pictures? Who... The numbers? We started it when we went to find a house with lights. Yeah, maybe they didn't mean the box for us. The box isn't for us. What if we've already interacted with ourselves? So, we're collapsing on ourselves right now.

You think that I would just put drugs in your food? Oh, my God. Okay. I'll show you. On top of all this, you think I'd drug you? I'll show you. Let's just see how much is in there. This is the vial I brought. Yeah, and a quarter of it is gone. But that's... She's had a couple of drops out of it. - That's it. - This is, like, high-grade pharmaceutical... It is watered down. You can't. You opened it up and watered it down? Okay, but if you took enough of it, isn't it true that you would have hallucinations? You would have to have a massive dose. You would have to take the entire bottle. Okay. Fine. But is it true? Yes. Okay. And is it also true... that one of the other effects can be paranoia? Yes, but you... Again, you would have to have all of it. The whole bottle. The whole bottle. And it would never... Even if all of us took a bottle each, it would never create a mass hallucination. - I'm not a criminal. - It would be a nice conclusion right now. Wouldn't this be great if we were hallucinating? - Well, it's not the explanation. - Fine. - I believe you. - This is the bottle. - She asked for it. I gave her some. - Okay. I-I did not drug your food. - I did not drug your food. - I... - Get it? - Lay off, okay? I swear to God. Thanks. Hey, where'd you get this? This is so cute. Oh, I got it at, Galaxy. That thrift store. Oh, I love that place. - That's great. - They have such cute stuff. I just... I need a drink. Yeah. Okay. I just want to wake up and start again, you know? Blue. It's not even cracked. What are we gonna do? We have to get the fuck out of here. Okay. - Okay. Let's take... - Take the book. - Take the book. - Do we take the box? - Take the box. This is what they... - Take it. Hey. You okay? Where'd you go? I need a drink. Hey. What... Where'd you go? I went to the house, dude. - I told you. - What happened? I just dropped the letter off. I saw the book. I was gonna... I was gonna smash the window... and take the book. I didn't do that, though."

I don't know what the hell she's thinking, but yeah, we're good. Come here. Hey. Is everything okay with Hugh's car? - What do you mean? - Well, did they take anything? You just checked on his car. Did they take anything? Doesn't make any sense at all. Do you think it's just someone trying to intimidate us? Intimidate? No. I... It's... None of this... It doesn't... I mean, it's like they're looking for something, and... - But there's nothing in there."
