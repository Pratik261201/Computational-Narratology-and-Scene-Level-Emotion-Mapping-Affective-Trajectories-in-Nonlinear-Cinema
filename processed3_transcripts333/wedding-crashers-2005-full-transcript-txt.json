Right now, right now she doesn't know where the kids are, do you? - Do not talk about me as a mother. - Are they at home? I'm so sick to death of you talking about me as a mother - and what I've done wrong! - They at your sister's? Where... they're probably at a firehouse somewhere. She'd just drop 'em off - with a fireman, you know? - Do not talk about that! I am sick of you accusing me of not being a good mother! - Are they at home? Are they at home? - Seven years I've been a good mother! A perfect mother? I can't have custody. Just remember when we went out. Just remember how you... Right now. Where is Tim right fucking now? Don't you talk about me being a mother. I hate you! Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you just kiss my left nut? - I told you this was a bad idea. - You know what, Ken? A bad idea would be to let your client walk outta here today and drag this thing out for another year, wasting more time and wasting more money. The only good idea is to let me and John do our job - and mediate this thing right here. - You wanna hear the crazy thing? I know it doesn't feel like it, but we're making progress. - Mm-hmm. - We settled the deal with the cars. Let's see, that takes us to frequent flyer miles. We're flying! - Those are mine. - I want them. You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna split 'em right down the middle. - How'd that be, Mr. Kroeger? - It would be no-not good at all! - I earned those miles! - Yeah, you earned them flying - to Denver to meet your whore. - Oh, Lord. Well, she's not afraid to express herself sexually - if that's what you mean. - She's a stripper, for God's sake! - She is not! - Her name is Chastity! She is white trash! Same as you. Hillbilly! That's it, go comatose for me, baby. You shut your mouth when you're talkin' to me! Hold it. This is getting confusing. You didn't always hate each other. There had to be some nice moments, during the courtship, maybe? - Or the wedding? - The wedding had to be fun! - You have your families together. - You have your decorations. Families coming together. That's a nice moment. - What'd you have to eat?",

It's a great band, it's a bad band, it's like pizza, baby. - It's good no matter what. - That's true. You got them... - There's music in the air! ...playing \"Shout\" and you hate it. - Yeah. # Oh-oh-oh-oh-hey # - # A little bit softer now # - # Oh-oh-oh-oh, hey # - # Shout now, jump up and shout now. # It's a good time, do you know what I mean? - Yeah. - Rubbin' up against each other, just a couple of kids who like to fuck, trying to make it honest. I get it. Guys, the real enemy here is the institution of marriage. It's not realistic, it's crazy! Hey, don't do this for the other person. It's about saying yes to yourself - and saying yes to your future. - Say yes. And have some opportunities for yourself. I'm sure you'd love to be free, maybe go out and meet some Latin guy that can dance, grind up on you, make you feel dangerous but also safe. And how about you? Don't you want to get inside Chastity without having to wonder if everyone's gonna find out? - God, wouldn't that be sweet? - Wouldn't that be nice? And have some Latin guy sweating all over you, talking to you in languages you don't understand, - needing you, wanting you, taking you? - All we're trying to say is, put your swords away for a second. Let's finish this and let's move on. Get out there and get some strange ass. Could you give her a glass of water so she can take that? Hey, John, that's weird. That glass looks half full to me. Wow, now that you mention it, it is half full. He can have the miles. Nah, sweetie, you take the miles. Great. Great! Let's sign the paperwork and we are done! This is just semantics. If you guys want to throw a couple miles at us, we'll take a couple. The big this is, is that we're all movin' on. Could you two just not talk anymore? Oh, good, you got it. Is it 100% goose down? - Yes. Why do you need this? - Are you sure? I sleep over at John's house every year for his birthday. Okay, that's not creepy. I guess it is a little creepy when a young man who happens to be an only child loses both of his parents in a tragic accident one month before his birthday and then has a best friend make a vow that he will never spend his birthday alone again.",

You're sitting there, you're wondering, \"Do I have food on my face? Am I eating? Am I talking too much? Are they talking enough? Am I interested? I'm not really interested. Should I play like I'm interested? But I'm not that interested, but I think she might be interested. But do I want to be interested? But now she's not interested.\" So now, all of sudden I'm... I'm starting to get interested. And when am I supposed to kiss her? Do I have to wait for the door? 'Cause then it's awkward, it's like \"Well, good night.\" Do you do like the ass-out hug? Where you like... you hug each other like this, and the ass sticks out because you're trying not to get too close. Or do you go right in and just kiss 'em on the lips or don't kiss 'em at all? It's very difficult trying to read the situation and all the while you're just really wondering, \"Are we gonna get hopped enough to make some bad decisions?\" And perhaps play a little game called \"Just the Tip.\" Just for a second, just to see how it feels, - or \"Ouch Ouch, You're on My Hair.\" - Okay. Okay, can... can you... can you put that so he... he can't see it? And thank you. Hey, Janice. Great talk. John? I gotta see you right away, it's important. What's going on? We've got three really big weeks ahead of us. It's wedding season, kid! You sandbagging son of a bitch! I got us down for 17 of them already. Okay, now, how many of 'em are cash bars? Great question, love where your head's at, and two of 'em actually are. But... I got us covered. Purple hearts. We won't have to pay for a drink all night. Oh yeah, perfect. We are gonna have tons and tons of opportunities to meet gorgeous ladies that are so aroused by the thought of marriage, that they'll throw their inhibitions to the wind. And who's gonna be there to catch 'em? Grab that net and catch that beautiful butterfly, pal! What do you like better? Christmas or wedding season? - Mr. Grey. - Yes, um, the answer would be, um...",

      "raw_text": "- wedding season? - Bingo. I'm gonna go get my suit. Oh, now who are we this time? Hey, Lou Epstein, I want you to meet a real mensch, Chuck Schwartz. Oh, stop. And as we carry on the tradition of thousands of years, we honor the eternal bond that stretches through the ages. I have known this couple for many years. Deborah I've actually known for her entire life. I was at her house when her parents brought her home from the hospital, and I was there the day she graduated from medical school. Josh I have known since his bar mitzvah, which those of you who were there know it was not a very pretty sight. But he has pulled himself together nicely, and he's grown into a remarkable young man himself. - Okay. - He never got the courage to ask her out, until 10 years later. Josh was in the emergency room, and he saw Debra again - and he said to himself... - Hi. \"Wait! That's the girl I'm going to marry!\" I now pronounce you man and wife. Mazel tov! Mazel tov, baby! From my family to yours, mazel tov. Beautiful. # Hava nagila # # Hava nagila # # Hava nagila, ba ba ba! # Oh my. You sly son of a bitch. # Nagila, hava nagila ve'nismecha # # Hava nagila, hava... # Does anyone know what this here is used for? - Rolling a fatty. - No, not... not for... where'd you learn that? You want to get a whole combination. You gotta get the frostings in the middle and on the other end. - # Ba-ba ba ba # - That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it! Come on! You both look beautiful up there today, particularly Debbie in that white dress. Enjoy it. After tomorrow, I don't think you're gonna be able to get away with wearing a white dress. Here, I'll just pick this off, I'll go grab another piece. That's it. - Ooh! - Whoa. In the words of the old country... - L'chaim! - L'chaim! Come here! I want you to take this note, bring it to that blonde girl. Hurry, 'cause I'm gonna time you. Go! Hi. Who gave this to you? You know, I saw you at the wedding. - And? - You were crying. Oh, shit. You weren't supposed to see that. Now you probably think I'm a big pussy. No, you were so sweet. Come here. Look, I knew I was never gonna be a professional bullfighter, - but that's not why I did it. - Weren't you scared? Can I say yes? - Sanjay Collins. - Chuck Vindaloo, excited to be here.",

        "- wedding season? - Bingo. I'm gonna go get my suit. Oh, now who are we this time? Hey, Lou Epstein, I want you to meet a real mensch, Chuck Schwartz. Oh, stop. And as we carry on the tradition of thousands of years, we honor the eternal bond that stretches through the ages. I have known this couple for many years. Deborah I've actually known for her entire life. I was at her house when her parents brought her home from the hospital, and I was there the day she graduated from medical school. Josh I have known since his bar mitzvah, which those of you who were there know it was not a very pretty sight. But he has pulled himself together nicely, and he's grown into a remarkable young man himself. - Okay. - He never got the courage to ask her out, until 10 years later. Josh was in the emergency room, and he saw Debra again - and he said to himself... - Hi. \"Wait! That's the girl I'm going to marry!\" I now pronounce you man and wife. Mazel tov! Mazel tov, baby! From my family to yours, mazel tov. Beautiful. # Hava nagila # # Hava nagila # # Hava nagila, ba ba ba! # Oh my. You sly son of a bitch. # Nagila, hava nagila ve'nismecha # # Hava nagila, hava... # Does anyone know what this here is used for? - Rolling a fatty. - No, not... not for... where'd you learn that? You want to get a whole combination. You gotta get the frostings in the middle and on the other end. - # Ba-ba ba ba # - That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it! Come on! You both look beautiful up there today, particularly Debbie in that white dress. Enjoy it. After tomorrow, I don't think you're gonna be able to get away with wearing a white dress. Here, I'll just pick this off, I'll go grab another piece. That's it. - Ooh! - Whoa. In the words of the old country... - L'chaim! - L'chaim! Come here! I want you to take this note, bring it to that blonde girl. Hurry, 'cause I'm gonna time you. Go! Hi. Who gave this to you? You know, I saw you at the wedding. - And? - You were crying. Oh, shit. You weren't supposed to see that. Now you probably think I'm a big pussy. No, you were so sweet. Come here. Look, I knew I was never gonna be a professional bullfighter, - but that's not why I did it. - Weren't you scared? Can I say yes? - Sanjay Collins. - Chuck Vindaloo, excited to be here."

That's what I really wanted. So how long have you and the Secretary been married? 30 years next April. Oh, that's beautiful. Yeah, and we were faithful for two of them. - Hmm? - Enjoy the party. Thanks. Secretary Cleary, John Ryan. - Hi, John. - I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your position paper on economic expansion in Micronesia. You've read my position paper? I read it while I was sailing my boat to Bermuda. A sailor? - Good man, take a seat. - Oh, thanks. You didn't happen to catch my speech on the Paraguayan debt and money supply issue, did you? Are you kidding me? I thought it was great. Your argument for the inverse ratio of capitalization to debt was genius. Now, if we can just get Congress not to be so shortsighted. Yes! Well put. \"Shortsighted.\" John, what do you say you and I head out to the deck - and light up a couple of cigars? - Stogies? - Yeah. - Why not? It's just that we lost a lot of really good men out there. I'm sorry. Gloria, I think I gotta go get some fresh air. Thank you so much for the dance and it was wonderful to meet you. I wish I were stronger. Jeremy! Jeremy, wait up! - John, you seem like an astute man. - Thank you. Maybe you can help explain something to me. You see that young man out there on the dock? - Sure. - That's my son Todd. 22 years old, the whole world in front of him, every advantage in life, advantages I never had... that's not exactly true. He had the same advantages I had, which is a hell of a lot of advantages. So here's my question. What's he got to be so morose about? Maybe he hasn't found something to believe in. Oh, he says he believes in art, but all I've seen him do is dribble his own blood on a canvas and smear it around with a stick! You know, some people call that art. It's crap! Whatever happened to public service, obligation to our fellow man? Well, maybe he's... maybe he's just trying to find his own way, his own path, I mean, you cast a pretty big shadow. Yeah. Well, perhaps... I should take it easy on him. Perhaps. Death, you are my bitch lover! Todd, that's good!",

Every time I look over, you're on your ass again. If I had any air in my lungs, I'd scream at you! Oh, now you're gonna blame me? 'Cause you're not athletic enough to stay on your two feet? I hate you. Let's take a daiquiri time-out. Daiquiris. Oh! Sweetheart, why don't you take him into the house and fix him up? - Sure, Mom. - Oh, don't baby him, - it just makes it worse. - Oh! My back hurts. Oh, great. Game's over. Satisfied? You got everyone on you now? Get all the attention. - It's hot out here. - Yeah, it is. You should have played in your underwear. I'll get you a drink. Oh, Jesus Christ. It burns. - Oh! Poor baby. - It stings. Oh, Jesus. You want me to blow on it? No. No no no. No no no. No, I don't need any blowing. I'm good, I'm good. - I'm... thank you. - Jeremy, I'm not wearing any panties. - Oh. Yeah. - That's right. - Ooh, ah, oh! - Um, uh, okay. That's fun. That's nice. Uh, yeah, that's fun, yeah. That's fun. Okay, Gloria, could you just stop for... That's funny, that's funny, - that's funny. - Ahem. Don't you worry, Miss Gloria. - Mum's the word. - Thank you, Randolph. A little more discreet, though, okay? Jesus Christ. Don't worry, he won't say anything. Okay, I'm a little confused. Just like eight hours ago you were a shy little virgin, and now you're not wearing any panties. I'm just trying to... - to catch up with you here. - You do that to me. Ooh. - Where's my little friend? - I do what... no no no. - Where's my little friend? - He's tired. He's tired. - Where's my little friend? - He's in time-out. He's in time-out. Gloria, please! I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted. I've had a very long day. Dry hump me up and down the field all afternoon. My leg's cut and bleeding. I'm just... I'm not really in the mood for this. Ow! Jesus Christ! My father warned me about people like you, Jeremy. I'm just another notch on your belt!"

Don't you fucking get up. - Sack, will you just stop?! - Okay okay. Is that true? No, well, no, it's... not entirely. No, it's a yes or no question. I know, but it's complicated. Yes or no? Yes or no? Yes... - with shades of grey. - Oh. I'm not perfect, but who are we kidding? Neither are you. And you wanna know what? I dig it! Jeremy tried to seduce me! You did? I want my painting back. The painting was a gift, Todd. I'm taking it with me. You had me going, son. I thought it was something special. There's a ferry leaving in 10 minutes. I suggest you be on it. Come on, let's go. I want you. I love you. He made a fool out of you, Claire. Come on, let's go. Sweetheart. Now bunch those panties up into a little ball. Put that little ball right in your mouth. - Oh, that's good. - Hang up the phone. Okay, and I will definitely call you back later then. - Come on, wrap it up. - Talk to you soon. Thank you, Larry. What the fuck? You can't knock anymore? - I know how I can get to her. - What? I know how I can get to Claire. Oh, John, you gotta drop this thing. I'm... I can't do this anymore with you, okay? It's been several months, and you haven't heard anything from her. She hasn't returned your phone calls, she's never responded to one of your letters, - she didn't respond to the candygram. - Right. God knows what happened to the little kitten that you got her. Because she didn't keep it and I know you're not raising that goddamn thing."
