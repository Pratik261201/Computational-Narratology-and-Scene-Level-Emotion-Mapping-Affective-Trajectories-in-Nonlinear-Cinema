French flag on coffin, cannon shot, rifle shot. I don't want Miss France's crown. You want Princess Lady Di. What? Sweetheart? Darling agathe. We need to advance the bar mitzvah. We must advance the date. What? You have to do it in a month. Why? It's my mother. What, \"my mother\"? She had an artery... my mother. Huh? She has a... \"corotopathy\". If we don't operate it, an artery will... burst. It must be operated in a month. No cold cuts or alcohol. Lots of rest and... warn your loved ones. It's okay? I'm sorry, darling. Sweetheart. Yes. Swear I won't tell my mom. I swear on my mother's castle. For Samu, how are we going to do it? In law, it's 13 years and 1 day. Do not worry. I will see... ... the biggest rabbi in France. He is not 13 years old, Samu. Honey, stop saying \"Samu\". It frightens me. It. What war do we win with that? THE WAR OF THE ATMOSPHERE. What's next? Christophe. \"Hip hip hip!\" \"HURRAY!\" Doesn't it work? Well yeah. Then... ... \"Atchic atchic atchic...\" 3 times, not 2. At home, that's it. It's 3 times. \"Atchic atchic!\" They are waiting for the 3rd. Give them the fucking 3rd! Otherwise they say, \"Ouch ouch.\" \"Atchic atchic atchic.\" \"AIE Aie Aie.\" \"AIE Aie Aie!\" The atmosphere is coming. The last thing. \"He really is...\" What the fuck is he? \"Great.\" No! \"Phenomenal.\" You see? Here. He is Aznavour. He is really great No! II really is, it really is... You too are there. You go on stage to stamp your feet. In the newspaper... From whom? By Claire Chazal Pas de Roselmack. It's you. You made humor. Do you want to liven it up, Coco's party?"
