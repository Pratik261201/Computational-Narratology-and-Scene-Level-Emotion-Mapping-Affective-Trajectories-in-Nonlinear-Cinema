No, ma'am, l'm afraid that's not allowed. Help me, l'm poor. LlLLlAN: No, listen, we're a whole wedding party. l'm the bride. l'm getting married. This seat is empty. She's obviously nervous. We'll calm her down and. . . l understand. But Claire is right. Everybody, go back to your seats. Okay, you especially. You have three seconds to get back to your seat.  You can't get anywhere in three seconds. Well, you'd better try. You are setting me up for a loss already. Thank you. Whatever you say, Stove. lt's Steve.  \"Stove.\" What kind of name is that? That's not a name. My name is Steve. Are you an appliance? No, l'm a man, and my name is Steve. You are a flight attendant. That's absolutely accurate. You can close that. Thank you.
