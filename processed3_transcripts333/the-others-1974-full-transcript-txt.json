Built by medieval Freemasons to ensure the transmission of symbols and the hermetic doctrine, our great cathedrals exerted a remarkable influence on many more modest examples of civil or religious architecture. In the western jamb of the portico we see a small sculpted angel holding a stone circle in his hands. Flamel had had a black marble circle inserted there with a fine gold fillet in the shape of a cross. Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! - Go! - Cut! The hermetic topics of the stylobate are developed on two overlapping rows to the right and left of the portico. The lower row consists of twelve medallions and the upper row of twelve figures. Do you see? It represents characters sitting on plinths adorned with vertical flutings that are sometimes concave, sometimes angular, and are located between the columns on trilobular arches. I thought you had gone to the countryside. I passed by the bookstore the other day and the employee told me you had gone to the countryside to get some rest. Yes. I'm trying to get some rest. Cut. LIBRARY OF THE AMERICAS THE OTHERS THE OTHERS a film written THE OTHERS directed by Here's your Ovid. But you don't have to buy it. Tournier's translation is still the best. - But the other one is more recent. - And more expensive. These days people spend too much on books. Stick to Tournier! I... Okay, I'll think about it. Excuse me, I'll be back. He won't be coming back. Mathieu, your father intends to go bankrupt. Don't you want a good translation of Ovid? I'll give you a discount. Who's gonna help me dress up? I need a costume for tonight. Are you allowed to dance with me? This guy's got her. Not him, not you. Which guy? And then I die. If we cast shadows, we must also have a dark side. Change, madam, from darkness. Come on, Mathieu. Darkness is mine. See you later, then. Vidal wants to play another game. I don't agree. He'd lose. Who knows in a game of chance? In poker, the cards matter less than the player. Less than luck? No. It's the player that matters. Whenever you want, I'll show you. Vidal got himself a partner. That's two of them wanting to beat me now. Allah is great.",

I had a dream about you tonight. You were at a costume ball. You wanted to reach for a big mirror at the back of the room. You were in danger. You had to get through a crowd. But those people were also pushing towards the mirror. You can't tell me I didn't work tonight. I managed to lose 2,300 francs playing poker against an imbecile. And I held the better cards. I see. It's a triumph. I feel the same way. Let's celebrate. Drop the money! To pay for it? Your jokes seem to be what everybody else takes seriously. It's a certain kind of humor. Come on. Let go. Furthermore, it's quite an idea to play poker when you're half a turkey. I always plucked you. It's about time for you to get out of that suit. I like it. I'm not taking it off anymore. That's it, everything's ready. The actors, the settings... an excellent crew. I even selected the extras one by one. Right now we're finishing the costumes and the three sets. My God, it's amazing: Those guys are from another world. They don't understand a word of your script and yet they give me everything I ask for. They spent a lot of money, you know? - By the way, if you want an advance... - No, I don't need money. It's great, your script, Mathieu. And I'm gonna turn it into a great movie. One can't write great things, Durtain. One can't make great movies either. You're not the same person with those rags. But expect your character to have... Bye, André. Mr. Spinoza... Agnès, did you notice anything on the past day? I mean... if there was something in his voice or his face. When you came up to talk to me, you know? Did you notice anything? I didn't notice anything. - Mr. Spinoza, you should... - You know what's wrong with me, Agnès? It's as if Mathieu had never been my son. As if I wasn't really Roger Spinoza. Last night he must have come to my house. - But I didn't see him. - Then how do you know? In the morning I found this piece of paper. It's his handwriting. I don't even remember the face I had. Mathieu had written a script, you know? And Durtain was about to film it. I had a role. The leading role. None of that matters now.",

I'm Mathieu Spinoza's father. Follow me, please. My visit may surprise you, but since my son died I've been trying to see his friends. You know, ma'am, now I think... they knew him better than I did. I don't think I have it. Very few people are looking for it. If you want I can try to find it for you. Don't be like that, Mr. Spinoza. I'm not well. I feel like I'm sick. I don't know how many times we've met. Not so much on the whole. He enjoyed being aggressive and yet we felt he was very close. He was a friend. I saw him the day before at the club. I know. - There was a costume ball. - Yes, I know. We danced. He looked very lively. - Then we talked about poker. - Mathieu didn't play very well. He believed in luck, above all. To show him he was wrong, Moreau invited him to play. It's weird. Back then none of that mattered. Lucien Moreau, Mr. Spinoza. Please, have a seat. I apologize, I have to go. Come and sit down, Lucien. What was that guy doing here? Come on, Agnès. Sit down, please. Come on! What can I do, Agnès? I feel worse and worse. What if I left for a few days? I could go to the countryside. Well then, you're the boss now. Maybe your sister can come help you? Of course, Mr. Spinoza. You can leave without worrying. How are you doing, Mr. Spinoza? So you know Moreau? We've been introduced. He's my producers' lawyer. A vulture, that guy. Mr. Spinoza, don't you want us to go to my house? It's next door. We'll be able to talk more quietly. Do you know what it's about? No, Mathieu never told me about the film. There were things he didn't tell me. A man dies. And from that moment on, terrible things happen to his wife, to his friends, to all those who were with him the last few days. As if death were a magical force, you know? As if everyone else was infected by death. It's marvelous. And it seems to be going well? Yes! They even started paying us. I had offered Mathieu an advance. You, Durtain? You offered him money? When? On the last day. Why? No. No reason. It's all set. We even bought the negative. Actually... The only problem left to solve has to do with Béatrice.",

Valérie, I can't stand you lying to me. Excuse me. I've been wanting to see you. - What's wrong with you, Valérie? - Lucien. Moreau. Do you remember him? He's angry. Do you like to ride horses?

I'm the professor Alexis Artaxerxès. Magician, charlatan, psychic... As you like. After I enchanted California, I'm here to make my debut in the capital of Julian the Apostate. And my informants assure me that the best place for that is the honorable circle to which they confer such wide prestige. Well then. When do we sign the contract? Guess, since you're a sorcerer! I don't guess. I read the thoughts directly. Do you read very often? What am I thinking about then? A person thinks he's thinking of one thing and thinks of another. You're thinking of a dead man. That's too easy. You read the papers. Let's find something more difficult. For example... I can guess the cards a player has in his hands. We can do the test. Do you play poker? One card. The same. Three thousand. Three thousand to see... With two pairs of aces. Three sevens. - High card. - Without me. Without me. It's worth a thousand. Plus two thousand. That's it for me. You'll have to wait until tomorrow. I owe you 27500 francs. No. You owe me exactly 2300. Except that you don't owe me anything since these cards are unreal. My cards are very real. As real or unreal as the game we just played. Tomorrow I'll pay you the 27500 francs. Tell me where to bring them. To the Hotel Michelet. That's where I live. But maybe it won't be so easy to find me there. That's where I live. But maybe it won't be so easy to find me there.",

I'm the professor Alexis Artaxerxès. Magician, charlatan, psychic... As you like. After I enchanted California, I'm here to make my debut in the capital of Julian the Apostate. And my informants assure me that the best place for that is the honorable circle to which they confer such wide prestige. Well then. When do we sign the contract? Guess, since you're a sorcerer! I don't guess. I read the thoughts directly. Do you read very often? What am I thinking about then? A person thinks he's thinking of one thing and thinks of another. You're thinking of a dead man. That's too easy. You read the papers. Let's find something more difficult. For example... I can guess the cards a player has in his hands. We can do the test. Do you play poker? One card. The same. Three thousand. Three thousand to see... With two pairs of aces. Three sevens. - High card. - Without me. Without me. It's worth a thousand. Plus two thousand. That's it for me. You'll have to wait until tomorrow. I owe you 27500 francs. No. You owe me exactly 2300. Except that you don't owe me anything since these cards are unreal. My cards are very real. As real or unreal as the game we just played. Tomorrow I'll pay you the 27500 francs. Tell me where to bring them. To the Hotel Michelet. That's where I live. But maybe it won't be so easy to find me there. That's where I live. But maybe it won't be so easy to find me there."

I think he was going on a trip. I can't find the key. Artaxerxès must be upstairs. He must have left. There he is. That's Artaxerxès. No way. That picture was always there. I came to Touraine, almost every year, to stay in my grandfather's village. He had arrived in Buenos Aires in 1896. My father was born there. Me too. After the accident... I was left alone. I was nine years old. They put me on an airplane. In Paris an old lady was waiting for me. My grandfather's sister. I like the house. She wanted me to keep it. I was going to tell you. A man I've never seen before stopped me near the observatory. He asked me to help someone injured in the woods. I followed him and all of a sudden he started hitting me with a branch. It's unbelievable, but that's what happened. I didn't tell anyone. I want to forget it. I want to tell you something and I don't dare. Monday I have to be at the observatory. Can't you stay one more day? It's not so serious, Valérie. I don't feel like going back. I'm coming with you. - Listen to me... - Stop babbling. Say what you want to tell me at once. Lucien, Valérie went to Landes with Spinoza. She told me so herself. I don't understand anymore. That boy kills himself, a charlatan beats me at poker, a madman steals a lot of money from me and burns it in front of me, and now I find out it was all the bookseller's setup. And Valérie, the only one that matters to me, is going with him. Not so long ago things were always happening in a way that I could foresee. Now I'm starting to think I never understood anything. But it can't be. It can't be! I need to talk to Valérie. - Are you staying here tonight? - Yes, sir. A journalist will be coming, to write an article. I told him he wasn't going to see anything extraordinary, but he insisted. Take it. Look at the pictures. Thank you. You can go, Jacques. See you tomorrow, Valérie. Does it interest you? Have you seen a man? Short. - A bit... - Yeah, I ran into him. Everything should be like that. Everything should be like a gift. Suddenly we have to offer ourselves to someone. And then everything that happens is a gift.",
