It feels like maybe it's just the first time you've been there... ...but... perhaps you've been there for a week... ...three months. It's kind of hard to say. I don't know. It's just an anonymous room. This guy. He's here already. Lenny! It's Leonard... ...like I told you before. Did you? I must have forgot. I guess I've already told you about my condition. Only every time I see you. - My car. - This is your car. You're in a playful mood. It's not good to make fun of someone's handicap. Just trying to have a little fun. Roll up your window. - It's broken. - I can get that fixed for you. - So where to, Sherlock? - I got a lead on a place. What the hell you wanna go there for? - You know it? - Yeah. It's just this fucked-up building. - Why do you wanna go there? - Don't remember. - Looks like somebody's home. - That thing's been here for years. What are you talking about? These tracks are only a few days old. Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas? Come on! Let's take a look inside. \"Teddy\". \"Don't believe his lies. He is the one. Kill him.\" I finally found him. How long have I been looking? Find anything? Didn't think so. Let's go. Fuck this. You're gonna pay for what you did. - Beg forgiveness, and then you pay. - Leonard. You don't have a clue, you freak. Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out. Leonard, you don't know what's going on. - You don't even know my name. - Teddy. That's 'cause you read it off a fucking picture. You don't know who you are. I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco. That's who you were. That's not what you've become. - Shut your mouth. - You want to know, Lenny? Come on. Come on. Let's go down to the basement. Let's go down, you and me, together. Then you'll know who you really are. No! It's just an anonymous room. There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway. Nothing except the Gideon Bible, which I, of course, read religiously. You know who you are, and you know kind of all about yourself. Butjust for day-to-day stuff, notes are really useful. Sammy Jankis had the same problem... ...but he really had no system. He wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes... ...but he'd get them all mixed up.",

You don't remember saying that? - That's the thing. I have this condition. - A condition? - It's my memory. - Amnesia? No, no. It's different from that. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am. I know all about myself. Since my injury, I can't make new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. Next time I see you, I'm not gonna remember this conversation. I don't even know if I've met you before. So, if I seem a little strange or rude or something... ...I've told you this before, haven't I? Yeah. I don't mean to mess with you, but it's so weird. - You don't remember me at all? - No. - We've talked a bunch of times. - I'm sure we have. What's the last thing you remember? My wife.

What makes you think he's my friend? - I just saw you together, that's all. - He's not my friend. - Okay. - If he calls or if he shows up here... ...give me a call in my room, okay? His name's Teddy? - Teddy, yeah. - All right. Look, I hope my condition's not gonna be a problem for you. No, not as long as you remember to pay the bill. Yeah. Okay. - Forty. - Forty. This guy... He's here already. Lenny! You really need a system if you're gonna make it work. You kind of learn to trust your own handwriting. That becomes an important part of your life.

I'm sorry I don't remember you. It's nothing personal. I do have information for you. You gave me a license plate number. Had my friend at DMV trace it. Guess what name came up. John Edward Gammell. John G. - Do you know him? - No. But his face on his driver's license looked really familiar. I think he's been in the bar, maybe. Here's a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all. Are you sure you want this? - Have I told you what this man did? - Yeah. Then you shouldn't have to ask. But even if you get revenge, you're not gonna remember it. You're not even gonna know that it happened. My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make any difference whether I know about it. Just because there are things I don't remember... ...doesn't make my actions meaningless. The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it? Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself... ...get another freaky tattoo. Tell me about her again. Why? Because you like to remember her. She was beautiful. - To me, she was perfect. - No. Don't just recite the words. Close your eyes... and remember her. You can just feel the details. The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words. And you can feel these extreme moments... ...even if you don't want to. You put these together, and you get the feel of a person. Enough to know how much you miss them... ...and how much you hate the person who took them away. I added an address in here. It might be useful. It's an abandoned place outside of town. A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there. It's isolated. Sounds perfect. - Do I owe you any... - I wasn't helping you for money. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. See, you have this condition. Are you still staying at the Discount Inn, room 304? You left it at my place. Yeah. - They treating you okay? - I don't remember. You know what we have in common? We are both survivors. You take care, Leonard. \"Remember Sammy Jankis.\" I met Sammy through work. Insurance. I was an investigator. I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phony.

        "...and you'll end up eating your underwear for breakfast. I guess that's why you have those freaky tattoos. Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible. I'm sorry I don't remember you. It's nothing personal. I do have information for you. You gave me a license plate number. Had my friend at DMV trace it. Guess what name came up. John Edward Gammell. John G. - Do you know him? - No. But his face on his driver's license looked really familiar. I think he's been in the bar, maybe. Here's a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all. Are you sure you want this? - Have I told you what this man did? - Yeah. Then you shouldn't have to ask. But even if you get revenge, you're not gonna remember it. You're not even gonna know that it happened. My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make any difference whether I know about it. Just because there are things I don't remember... ...doesn't make my actions meaningless. The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it? Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself... ...get another freaky tattoo. Tell me about her again. Why? Because you like to remember her. She was beautiful. - To me, she was perfect. - No. Don't just recite the words. Close your eyes... and remember her. You can just feel the details. The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words. And you can feel these extreme moments... ...even if you don't want to. You put these together, and you get the feel of a person. Enough to know how much you miss them... ...and how much you hate the person who took them away. I added an address in here. It might be useful. It's an abandoned place outside of town. A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there. It's isolated. Sounds perfect. - Do I owe you any... - I wasn't helping you for money. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. See, you have this condition. Are you still staying at the Discount Inn, room 304? You left it at my place. Yeah. - They treating you okay? - I don't remember. You know what we have in common? We are both survivors. You take care, Leonard. \"Remember Sammy Jankis.\" I met Sammy through work. Insurance. I was an investigator. I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phony. I had to see through people's bullshit. It was useful experience, 'cause now it's my life."

Go in and reason with him! - Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea! - Calm down. Take it easy. You're safe. It's okay. Come on. Just sit down. Sit down. Here. Sit down. Okay. You're okay. I'll just get some ice for your face. Here. I did exactly what you told me to do. I went to Dodd... ...and I told him that I didn't have any of Jimmy's money... ...or the drugs... ...and that this Teddy must have taken everything. And what did he say? He didn't believe me. He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me. Then he just started hitting me. Where is he? - Why? - I'll go see him. And? I'll give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy. He'll kill you, Lenny. My wife used to call me Lenny. Yeah? Yeah. I hated it. This guy is so dangerous. - Let's just think of something else, okay? - No, no. You just tell me what he looks like... and where I can find him. - Have you got a pen? - In my purse. He'll probably find you. - What do you mean? - I told him about your car. Why? He was beating the shit out of me. I had to tell him something."

Your wife surviving the assault. Her not believing your condition. The torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside. The insulin. That's Sammy, not me. I told you about Sammy. Yeah, right. Like you tell yourself over and over again. Conditioning yourself to remember. - Learning through repetition. - Sammy let his wife kill herself. - Sammy ended up in an institution. - Sammy was a con man, a faker. I never said that Sammy was faking. You exposed him for what he was... a fraud. But I was wrong. That's the whole point. - See, Sammy's wife came to me. - Sammy didn't have a wife. It was your wife who had diabetes. Ouch. My wife wasn't diabetic. You sure? - Ouch. Cut it out. - She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong with you? I guess I can only make you remember the things you wanna be true. - Like old Jimmy down there. - He's not the right guy. He was to you. Come on. You got your revenge. Enjoy it while you still remember. What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not? - It makes all the difference. - Why? You're never gonna know. - Yes, I will. - No, you won't. I will. Somehow I'll know. You won't remember! When it's done, I will know. It'll be different. I thought so too. In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't! That's right. The real John G. I helped you find him over a year ago. He's already dead. - Don't lie to me anymore. - Look, Lenny. I was the cop assigned to your wife's case. I believed you. I thought you deserved a chance for revenge. I'm the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night...",

Couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn't live alone. But when you killed him, I was so convinced that you'd remember. But it didn't stick. Like nothing ever sticks.

I gave you a reason to live, and you were more than happy to help. You don't want the truth. You make up your own truth. Like your police file. It was complete when I gave it to you. Who took out the 12 pages? - You, probably. - No, it wasn't me. See, it was you. - Why would I do that? - To create a puzzle you could never solve. You know how many towns?

Lenny, come on. You're not a killer. That's why you're so good at it. What are you doing? You know what time it is? It's beer o'clock. I'm buying. Fuck. I'm not a killer.

Hey, that's not your car! - It is now. - Jesus Christ, you can't take it! - Why not? - Because the guy you just killed owns it! Somebody'll recognize it!
