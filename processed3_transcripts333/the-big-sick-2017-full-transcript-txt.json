And people are always asking me, what was that like? Really not that different from here. I mean, we played cricket, which is just a spicier version of baseball. And we prayed a lot. -Well, not a lot. Just five times a day. - and we marry someone our parents find for us, arranged marriage, you know? But for me, it was probably that we got episodes of knight rider a little bit later. And by \"little bit later,\" I mean we just got episode two. --But other than that, it was exactly the same. So, these are my real journals, honestly. And this is the woman who wrote them. - Poor gal. Yeah. She-she has no idea that, like, giant titties are about to sprout and change her life dramatically. So, uh, thank you guys... There's no bad crowds, dude, only bad comedians. You complain about the crowd, like, all the time. Yeah, like, that's when they're really bad. That's like 90% of the time they're really bad? Look, will you just watch and give me notes tonight, all right? If we both give each other notes, I think it helps. Your notes are just, add more fucks into the bit. -That doesn't help anybody. -Hey, fuck, fuck's a funny word. It's soft on the top and it's hard on the end. That was truly horrible. -That was so bad. -What happened? -Just watch. -I'll watch. I'll give you notes. -All right. Thank you. -Hey, that was great. No, he didn't even crack a smile. - I thought I was gonna puke. Oh. -Who? Bob dalavan. Who's Bob dalavan? Bob dalavan works for the Montreal comedy festival, you fucking doof. -He's here? -Cj: Yes. Don't you want to get noticed? -Don't you want to move to L.A.? -Oh, my god. Hang out with Elijah wood and shit? Nobody's on stage? No. He might've been doing cocaine. Was he doing cocaine recreationally? True cokehead. -Cokehead. -I wonder if he was. Now, before I bring out the next guy, you guys know tonight is jell-o shot Tuesday! And we all know what happens after eight jell-o shots. We urinate all over ourselves and... puke. --Okay, so I'm gonna bring up the next comic. -Confidence. Poise. -You know this man... -Give it up for Mr. Chris Jones! -Smile. -Chris! -He's like if a serial killer fucked an inspirational speaker.",

You put out chairs, you do five minutes. -You know the deal. -Come on, man. I'll double it up next time. Come on. What are you gonna do in there? -I'm making up next week's schedule. -Okay, cool. I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was trying to mansplain to her that, you know, we-we are on one little rock orbiting one star in a galaxy of a billion stars in a universe full of a billion galaxies. You know, so I forgot your birthday. - Who gives a shit? Like, you are cosmically overreacting to this. Honestly, you are being super selfish. --You're right, but you're selfish. Hey. Have you guys heard of this drug cocktail called cheese? Uh, I saw these news reports, so I looked up what cheese is, and cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol pm and heroin. So, really, it's heroin. Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do the heroin. It's very powerful. --You already have heroin. Is Pakistan in the house? Really? You're not from Pakistan. I would've noticed you. Are you kidding me? -Mm. He just gave you Montreal? Like, you don't have to showcase - or audition or anything. - No. It was too easy, almost. Like, I wanted to struggle. I wanted, I wanted a story to be able to tell on talk shows, and instead, like... You guys don't know how tough it is not to struggle. It's-it's a struggle succeeding effortlessly. Did he say anything about me? Sure. -What about me? -He, they, both of you. He said, \"those guys performed.\" I truly hate you, actually. We all hate you. -Hi. -Hi. -Hello. -Um, my name's kumail. Yeah, we know. Yeah, we saw you perform. Now that the niceties are out of the way, um, I have to tell you that when you yelled at me, it really threw me off, and, uh, you really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's so rude. I didn't heckle you. I just whoo-hoo'd you. It's supportive. -Okay, that's a common misconception. -Uh-huh. But yelling anything at a comedian is considered heckling. Heckling doesn't have to be negative. So, if I, if I yelled out, like, \"you're amazing in bed!\" --That'd be a heckle?",

It roughly translates to \"dweeb.\" I'll show you a picture. Of you in high school? Oh, my god. -Boom. -No. And I'm thinking I'm killing it right now. What inspired this haircut? Hugh Grant. -No. -Yeah. -Oh, no. -Big fan. And you're so serious, too. Okay. I read in an interview with Hugh Grant -he said he doesn't smile. -No. That's not real. 'Cause it makes his face look fat, so I didn't... I didn't smile in pictures - for many years. What were you like in high school? Um... Were you, like, voted, like... -Most sexy? -No. I was voted most noticeable. That's good. No, it's really not good. I, uh, had acne and i was a goth, and... I had this terrible perm. Um, yeah, the kids called me beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually, I do know why. It's because they thought i looked like beetlejuice. I think I'm done with this subject. In fact, i think I'm gonna go home. Wait, wait. We haven't even had sex again yet. Yeah, I'm just not that kind of girl. I only have sex once on the first date. -Wow. -Plus a hand job. Okay, well, i haven't had that, so... You don't get that because you made fun of me. What is happening? What are you doing? I'm changing under this blanket. I've seen everything. Do you remember? We were just having sex. --Yeah, but we were, like, in the throes of passion then, and... Listen, I had a really nice time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna, like, call an uber, go home, and I hope... - Just... Your driver will be ready as soon as he puts on his pants. Were you available for rides while we were fucking?

Just wait for it to kick in. -The plot kicks in really soon. -Okay. Your loss. Nine times nine. Nine killed you. That was fun. Uh, thanks for the ride home, but we got to stop doing this. -Yeah. -I know I've said that before, but I really do mean it. I can't be doing this right now. I know, I know. Totally. 100%. I agree with you. -So don't call me again. -I won't. I promise. Good luck on all your future endeavors. Oh, yeah, thank you. Hey, can we have an awkward hug before we part forever? -Okay. -Okay. Uh... -Bye. -Bye. Uh, you just promised never to call me again, so... It's really cold out here. It's so cold. You make a pretty good point. It is a lot warmer in here. It is warmer in here. -You know, it's really nice upstairs. -Is it? Whoa. Whoa. What are you doing? Okay. Just trying to get comfy. Oh, let me see. Who could that be? Oh, I wonder who that could be. - Uncle. Oh, let me see who is that. Emily, so, has kumail told you that in addition to being an uber driver, he also has a one-man show? No, he did not tell me that. -Do you really? -Oh, it's really nothing. It's just something I'm fiddling around with. How is a one-man show different -from stand-up? -It's really not. I guess it's because there's lots of, like, - wigs and costume changes. - -and there's a lot of acting in it. -Mm. And then, like, at the end of it, you've got this very awkward conversation where you go, \"i really liked it.\" But I thought you really liked it. I... really liked it. I can't wait to see this show."

Oh, my god. -Whoa, you okay? -Yep. -What happened? -Do you... -Totally fine. Do you need... No, I think I just tweaked my ankle. ...assistance? I took this stupid hip-hop dance class last weekend. You should get it looked at. Do you want ice? -I don't need anything. -I can get you a bag of ice. Look, I'm walking on it. I'm totally fine. -I can carry you. -Kumail, seriously, stop. -I can carry you the rest of the day. -Stop. Hey, I liked your friends. That Craig guy? Or was it Greg?

I know this isn't the news you were hoping for, but we aren't ready to bring Emily out of the coma yet. Oh. Why? Uh, what happened? The antibiotics aren't doing what we'd hoped they would, and we don't want to mess around, so tomorrow morning, we're gonna perform surgery to remove the infection. - Oh, wait one second. -Oh. Dr. spellman told us that the antibiotics would work. -Yeah. -I mean, he didn't say anything at all about surgery. So what-- what does that mean? Surgery? What kind of surgery? It's called thoracentesis. It's a very common procedure. We're gonna go in between the ribs and remove the infection. An-and... -Terry: How do you spell that, please? And what is it? What's the name?",

There is only one thing that we have ever asked for you, kumi, that you be a good Muslim and you marry a Pakistani girl! That is it! One thing! Can I ask you something? Something that has never made sense to me. Why did you bring me here if you wanted me to not have an American life?

Went through this experience... But you have to understand that that all happened when I was asleep. Like, you felt one way a few weeks ago, and now you're saying you feel the total opposite way. And the only thing that's changed is that I was in a coma. Honestly, i-i... I look at all of this, and I just think, you know, I just can't do it again. -And I can't... -I... I can't be the reason that you don't have a family. It just feels totally different now. And I can't do that again. Do you understand? -Okay. -Okay? - Okay. Sorry. Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. Kya haal hai? Oh, there's no plate. Oh. Oh, I forgot, um, I've decided I won't let you kick me out of the family. Since I'm a member of the family, it would stand to reason that I would get a vote in whether or not i get kicked out, and that vote would have to be unanimous-- standard parliamentary procedure. So, all those in favor of not kicking kumail out of the family, raise your hand. Great. Motion to kick kumail out of the family denied. So you guys can just talk to me. Okay, you're giving me the silent treatment. I figured that was what was gonna happen. I have a solution. So, \"hi, how are you?\" That's just a real basic one. You know. \"Pass the salt.\" Practical. \"Always with the comedy.\" Mom, made that one specially for you. \"Kumail, how did you become so much more handsome than your brother naveed?\" Bullshit.

        "I know I was a terrible boyfriend... But I have changed. And I am the person you need me to be. I really am. So... Will you take me back? Kumail, I'm really glad that you... Went through this experience... But you have to understand that that all happened when I was asleep. Like, you felt one way a few weeks ago, and now you're saying you feel the total opposite way. And the only thing that's changed is that I was in a coma. Honestly, i-i... I look at all of this, and I just think, you know, I just can't do it again. -And I can't... -I... I can't be the reason that you don't have a family. It just feels totally different now. And I can't do that again. Do you understand? -Okay. -Okay? - Okay. Sorry. Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. Kya haal hai? Oh, there's no plate. Oh. Oh, I forgot, um, I've decided I won't let you kick me out of the family. Since I'm a member of the family, it would stand to reason that I would get a vote in whether or not i get kicked out, and that vote would have to be unanimous-- standard parliamentary procedure. So, all those in favor of not kicking kumail out of the family, raise your hand. Great. Motion to kick kumail out of the family denied. So you guys can just talk to me. Okay, you're giving me the silent treatment. I figured that was what was gonna happen. I have a solution. So, \"hi, how are you?\" That's just a real basic one. You know. \"Pass the salt.\" Practical. \"Always with the comedy.\" Mom, made that one specially for you. \"Kumail, how did you become so much more handsome than your brother naveed?\" Bullshit. I admit, this one is designed to stir up some controversy. \"It's interesting how you can't really \"kick someone out of your family, because they will always be your family.\" I agree with that one.
