Is this low-viscosity rayon? Yes, of course. With a half-loop top stitching on the hem? Absolutely. It's one of a kind. It's impossible to use a half-loop top stitching on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn't just get it in. I saw it in Teen Vogue a year ago. So if you're trying to sell it to me for full price, you picked the wrong girl. Ow. Girls, this is it. In a few hours, I'll be the future Mrs Warner Huntington III. Hello. Wow. You look so beautiful. So do you. Let's get out of here. Ok. It must be strange having such perfect eyes. God, you're so wonderful. Elle, thank you. - Here's to us. - To us. - Elle... - Yes. One of the reasons I wanted to come here tonight was to discuss our future. I am fully amenable to that discussion. Good. You know how we've been having all kinds of fun lately? Yeah. Well, Harvard is gonna be different. Law school is a completely different world, and I need to be serious. Of course. I mean, my family expects a lot from me. - Right. - I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day. And I fully support that, Warner. You know that, right? Absolutely. But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm 30, I need to stop dicking around. Oh, Warner... I completely agree. Well, that's why I think it's time for us... Elle... - Pooh Bear... - Yes? - I do. - I think we should break up. What'? I've been thinking about it, and I think it's the right thing to do. You're breaking up with me? - I thought you were proposing. - Proposing? Elle. If I'm gonna be a senator, well, I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn. So you're breaking up with me because I'm too... blonde? No. That's not entirely true. Then what? My boobs are too big? Your boobs are fine. So when you said you would always love me, you were just dicking around? Elle, I do love you. I... I just can't marry you. You have no idea the pressure that I am under. My family has five generations of senators. My brother's in the top three at Yale Law, and he just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake. Bad salad. Sweetie... Pooh Bear? It's not like I have a choice here, sweetheart.",

Harvard won't be impressed that you aced History of Polka Dots. What are your backups? I don't need backups. I'm going to Harvard. Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors. Ok. And a heck of an admissions essay. Right. And at least a 175 on your LSATs. I once had to judge a tighty-Whitey contest for Lambda Kappa Pi. Trust me. I can handle anything. - Thanks. - Welcome. Because I have a metrabolism. I have a really high metrabolism. It's metabolism... Oh, my God. What are you doing? Reading about the LSATs. My cousin had that. You get a really bad rash on your... The LSATs are an exam. Girls, I'm going to Harvard. - You mean, like, on vacay? - Let's all go. Road trip. No. I'm going to Harvard Law School. Why? Elle. Elle... I know you're upset about all this, but can't you just take a Percocet? Ok. Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll totally want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan. But isn't it hard to get into law school? I have the highest GPA in Delta Nu. Oh, well. Here. You're gonna need this. - Your scrunchie? - My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish. You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a lap dance after the final. Yeah. Luckily. Oh, hi. My name is Elle Woods, and for my admissions essay, I'm gonna tell all of you at Harvard why I'm gonna make an amazing lawyer. As president of my sorority, I'm skilled at commanding the attention of a room, and discussing very important issues. It has come to my attention that the maintenance staff is switching our toilet paper from Charmin to generic. All those opposed to chafing, say \"aye\". Aye. \"A: Neither type of opera or neither type of rap is on sale. B: Neither type of jazz and neither type of opera is on sale. C: Neither type of opera...\" - Party. - Delta Nu, we love you. Hey. Ok. I'm able to recall hundreds of important details at the drop of a hat. Hey, Elle, do you know what happened on Days of Our Lives yesterday? Why yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity.",

You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors. Ok. And a heck of an admissions essay. Right. And at least a 175 on your LSATs. I once had to judge a tighty-Whitey contest for Lambda Kappa Pi. Trust me. I can handle anything. - Thanks. - Welcome. Because I have a metrabolism. I have a really high metrabolism. It's metabolism... Oh, my God. What are you doing? Reading about the LSATs. My cousin had that. You get a really bad rash on your... The LSATs are an exam. Girls, I'm going to Harvard. - You mean, like, on vacay? - Let's all go. Road trip. No. I'm going to Harvard Law School. Why? Elle. Elle... I know you're upset about all this, but can't you just take a Percocet? Ok. Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll totally want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan. But isn't it hard to get into law school? I have the highest GPA in Delta Nu. Oh, well. Here. You're gonna need this. - Your scrunchie? - My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish. You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a lap dance after the final. Yeah. Luckily. Oh, hi. My name is Elle Woods, and for my admissions essay, I'm gonna tell all of you at Harvard why I'm gonna make an amazing lawyer. As president of my sorority, I'm skilled at commanding the attention of a room, and discussing very important issues. It has come to my attention that the maintenance staff is switching our toilet paper from Charmin to generic. All those opposed to chafing, say \"aye\". Aye. \"A: Neither type of opera or neither type of rap is on sale. B: Neither type of jazz and neither type of opera is on sale. C: Neither type of opera...\" - Party. - Delta Nu, we love you. Hey. Ok. I'm able to recall hundreds of important details at the drop of a hat. Hey, Elle, do you know what happened on Days of Our Lives yesterday? Why yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity."

Except when I dress up as a frigid bitch, I try not to look so constipated. She's horrible. You've got the ring, sweetie. How you doing? Warner. The English language is all about subliminal domination. Take the word, \"semester,\" ok? This is a perfect example of this school's discriminatory preference of semen to ovaries.

Swinney, who was also a private sperm donor, was allowed visitation rights as long as he came to terms with the hours set forth by the parents. So, if we're sticking to past precedent, I mean, Mr Latimer wasn't stalking. He was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation. But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor.

Although Mr Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of every sperm emission made throughout his life. Interesting. Why do you ask? Well, unless the defendant attempted to Contact every single one-night stand to determine if a child resulted in those unions, he has no parental claim over this child, whatsoever. Why now? Why this sperm? - I see your point. - And for that matter, all masturbatory emissions where his sperm was clearly not seeking an egg, could be termed reckless abandonment.

What is it? - Oh, I can't tell you. - Why the hell not? Because I promised her I'd keep it a secret. And I can't break the bonds of Sisterhood. Screw Sisterhood. This is a murder trial, not some scandal at the sorority house. I want the alibi. I can't give it to you. But I can tell you she is innocent. Mr Callahan, Mrs Windham Vandermark is on line two for you. Someone reason with her while I take this. Are you crazy? Just tell him the alibi. No. We'll lose the case if you don't. Then we're not very good lawyers. If you tell him, he'll probably hire you as a summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself. - I gave her my word, Warner. - So what? The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with the fact that her interview is today. She's at a spa in the Berkshires. A spa. Isn't that kind of like your mother ship? I could go if you want me to.",

I was getting... - Huh? - Liposuction. Oh, God. - No. - I know. I'm a fraud. But it's not like normal women can have this ass. If my fans knew that I bought it, I would lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I'd rather go to jail than lose my reputation. Brooke... your secret's safe with me. Thank you. Vivian, grab me some coffee. We got two interviews tomorrow that Gerard and Bobby are gonna handle, and the ex-wife in an hour. According to this Communiqué from the prison, our client apparently had a visit from her sister. A Miss Delta Nu. - Anyone you know? - Yes. I went to visit her. What the hell do you mean, you \"went to visit her\"? I went to get her alibi. - Did you get it? - It's really good. Well, great. What is it? - Oh, I can't tell you. - Why the hell not? Because I promised her I'd keep it a secret. And I can't break the bonds of Sisterhood. Screw Sisterhood. This is a murder trial, not some scandal at the sorority house. I want the alibi. I can't give it to you. But I can tell you she is innocent. Mr Callahan, Mrs Windham Vandermark is on line two for you. Someone reason with her while I take this. Are you crazy? Just tell him the alibi. No. We'll lose the case if you don't. Then we're not very good lawyers. If you tell him, he'll probably hire you as a summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself. - I gave her my word, Warner. - So what? The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with the fact that her interview is today. She's at a spa in the Berkshires. A spa. Isn't that kind of like your mother ship? I could go if you want me to."

Brooke would never tell a woman that she was too fat. And she seems to me like she's hiding something. - Maybe it's not what you think. - Maybe it's exactly what I think. You know, you're really being a butthead. A butthead? Why would you call me that? You just need to have a little more faith in people. You might be surprised. I can't believe you just called me a butthead. No one's called me that since about the ninth grade. Maybe not to your face. So this is what a spa looks like. Wow. How do we find her? I called ahead. She's in the mud room. She's not... naked, is she? Mrs Windham Vandermark? So, you found me. Yes. We're from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Callahan. We're here to ask you a few questions. So, I hear that that little tart from California shot poor Heyworth. Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe that it did? Well, I've never actually met the woman. But my daughter tells me she can be quite the little bitch. Now, did your daughter ever mention anything to you about the relationship between Brooke and Heyworth? Well, she did say that they humped like gorillas. I guess it wasn't enough, though, for Brooke. - Why do you say that? - Well... Haven't you seen the cabana boy? - She's lying. - And you know this for a fact? Did you see the icky brown colour of her hair? So? Now you discriminate against brunettes? Why shouldn't I? I'm discriminated against as a blonde. You know, being a blonde is actually a pretty powerful thing. You hold more cards than you think you do. I personally would like to see you take that power and channel it towards the greater good. - Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. - Hey. - Yeah? How do you think I'd look as a blond? I'm not sure you could handle it. - Bye. - Bye. So I called your room last night. I heard. I was thinking maybe we could go out sometime. No. You're a dork. I'm in... law school. Look, I'm not gonna go out with you. I can't believe you'd even ask. Girls like me don't go out with losers like you. Let's get out of here. Excuse me. - Why didn't you call me? - What? We spent a beautiful night together, and I never hear from you again?",

Brooke Windham, this case is dismissed. Mrs Windham, you are free to go. Yes. How did you know Chutney was lying? Because she's brilliant, of course. The rules of hair care are simple and finite. Any Cosmo girl would've known. Elle. Elle. Elle. Elle. What? I just wanted to say that you were... so brilliant in there. And that... I was wrong. And... you are the girl for me. - Really? - Yes. Pooh Bear... I love you. Oh, Warner. I've waited so long to hear you say that. But if I'm gonna be a partner in a law firm by the time I'm 30, I need a boyfriend who's not such a complete bonehead. Thank you, boys. Ladies and gentlemen, I present the graduates of Harvard Law School. Class of 2004. I am personally very honoured to introduce this year's class-elected speaker. After getting off to a quite interesting start here at Harvard, she graduates today with an invitation to join one of Boston's most prestigious law firms. I am sure we are going to see great things from her. Ladies and gentlemen, Elle Woods. On our very first day at Harvard, a very wise professor quoted Aristotle. \"The law is reason free from passion.\" Well, no offence to Aristotle, but in my three years at Harvard, I have come to find that passion is a key ingredient to the study and practise of law... and of life. It is with passion, courage of conviction, and strong sense of self that we take our next steps into the world, remembering that first impressions are not always correct. You must always have faith in people... and most importantly... you must always have faith in yourself. Congratulations, class of 2004. We did it.
