You like to do it in bed, or somewhere else? Being tied up, blindfolded? The door's this way. No. What do you want? Two women together? Two naked women and they are touching each other and they want you? Is that it? All men like this fantasy. You think about another man fucking Lisa, and you're watching and touching yourself while she begs him for more. Is that it? You think about rape. Oh, no, that is usually for woman. That's fine. I'm calling the police. You have fantasies in your book? Tell me your fantasies. The bad man bends a girl over his desk, and forces himself inside of her. - Just-- - Come come. You're fucking crazy, aren't you? - So tell me. - Hello? Yeah. Does anybody there speak English? What you really want-- The fuck is wrong with you? Tell me your fantasies. You're shy, or you're afraid of what you really want, because it's not nice. - Give me the-- Because it's dark, not nice for an American. Is that it? What the fuck is wrong with you, huh? You come into my fucking house, you fuck with me, you come onto me. I'm a nice guy, and you keep giving me shit. Come on, Adam. I know you want to fuck me. Oh, you're so fucking wrong. No, that's why you let me stay. You think I'm a murderer, but you let me stay because you want to fuck me. That's a bunch of bullshit. You flatter yourself. No, I just know men. Oh. If I wanted to fuck you, I'd have done it by now. And if I wanted to kill you, I would have done it by now. I'm sorry. If you don't level with me, I can't help you. You know the coffeehouse near the theater? I used to work there. I was 18. I liked it. I was already married to Barnabas. And Katalin-- Katy's our little girl. She was one. Barnabas! We lived with his parents and his little sister, Anna. It was a big squash. I didn't mind, but Barnabas always talked about having something on our own. But it was impossible. We couldn't afford to pay this. Barnabas, take it. Barnabas was an electrical technician, but he was really a musician. He had big dreams. He wanted to go to America. There was a man who came every day and always sat at my tables. Many people did not like him because he had been a big communist. I thought he was nice. His name was Jozsef. He was a businessman, and made some money. Some of the women did not like me talking to him. They said he was only rich because he had stolen from the people.

        "That was Lisa on the phone. I know. She said there was a stabbing near the metro this morning. And you think I did it? Well, you have a knife with blood on it. Then you're right. I'm a murderer. Look, I don't know where you're going with this game, but, uh, I'm not playing anymore. OK? Why not? You liked playing games before. I saw it excited you. So what does excite you, Adam? You like to watch me caress myself? Shall I make myself come for you? I don't think we were talking about me. Oh, I think we should. Before I trust you. Perhaps you can show what is in your heart. So I should know whether to run again. So what do you like? You like to make love to Lisa? Sex with emotions? You on top, or underneath? You like to do it in bed, or somewhere else? Being tied up, blindfolded? The door's this way. No. What do you want? Two women together? Two naked women and they are touching each other and they want you? Is that it? All men like this fantasy. You think about another man fucking Lisa, and you're watching and touching yourself while she begs him for more. Is that it? You think about rape. Oh, no, that is usually for woman. That's fine. I'm calling the police. You have fantasies in your book? Tell me your fantasies. The bad man bends a girl over his desk, and forces himself inside of her. - Just-- - Come come. You're fucking crazy, aren't you? - So tell me. - Hello? Yeah. Does anybody there speak English? What you really want-- The fuck is wrong with you? Tell me your fantasies. You're shy, or you're afraid of what you really want, because it's not nice. - Give me the-- Because it's dark, not nice for an American. Is that it? What the fuck is wrong with you, huh? You come into my fucking house, you fuck with me, you come onto me. I'm a nice guy, and you keep giving me shit. Come on, Adam. I know you want to fuck me. Oh, you're so fucking wrong. No, that's why you let me stay. You think I'm a murderer, but you let me stay because you want to fuck me. That's a bunch of bullshit. You flatter yourself. No, I just know men. Oh.

Anyone can duel with words. Firing a gun requires courage. Commitment. I'd do the same to protect Marta. How is she? Undergoing treatment. Do they think she'll get any better? Thank you."
