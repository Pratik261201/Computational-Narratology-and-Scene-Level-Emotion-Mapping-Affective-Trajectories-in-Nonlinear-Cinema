      "raw_text": "(JP) You little brats, beat it! Hey... It should have been me! I should be the one going to that Jap's house. You'll miss the train. Hurry. 'PART ONE' 'Kouzuki Noriaki' (JP) Go back to sleep. (JP) We're still far from the house. (JP) Pleased to meet you. I am Okju. This property has three buildings. A Western-style wing by an English architect and a Japanese wing form the main house. Not even in Japan is there a building combining two styles. It reflects Master's admiration for Japan and England. Next is the annex which Master had furnished as a library. Last, the servants' quarters. As the Lady's handmaiden you won't sleep there. You may eat her leftover food, but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls. Used soap is for the steward. Anyone caught pilfering is expelled that day. I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako. \"Tamako\" is you. Your name Okju in Japanese. - Call me Sasaki. - Yes, ma'am. The Lady's routine is simple. Taking a walk, or reading for Master. Among the richest men, Master is the greatest book lover. And among book lovers, he is the richest. His ties to the colonial government even let us use electricity. In such a home, you know what's expected of a maid like you? Don't be alarmed at the blackouts. I sleep in here? Miss Hideko wakes easily on account of her nerves. She's behind this door? (JP) Mother! (JP) Mother! (JP) Mother! (JP) Miss! (JP) Miss, are you alright? (JP) Junko! Is that you? (JP) Junko was kicked out, Miss. I'm the new girl. (JP) Seems you had a bad dream. (JP) You see that big cherry tree? (JP) My aunt went mad and hanged herself there. (JP) Sometimes on moonless nights, (JP) my aunt's ghost (JP) dangles from that branch. (JP) Here, drink up. (JP) When babies cry, my auntie feeds them a spoonful of sake. \"Sweet bird, sweet bird \"My sweet bluebird \"What scent is this, that fills my nose?\" You think I'm Tamako, a poor Korean handmaiden. But my real name's Nam Sookee. Raised by Miss Boksun, top purveyor of stolen goods. I was able at age 5 to tell a real coin from a fake. Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai, and studied pickpocketing from Kutan, but these babies will never learn such useful skills. Abandoned as newborns, we'll wash and feed them, then sell them to Japan. Such meaningful work.",

I'll tell you the story of an interpreter, who bribed his way into translating for high officials. After helping Japan annex Korea, he got rights to a gold mine. Now he wants to turn fully Japanese. So he gets naturalized, marries the daughter of a fallen Japanese noble, and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki. Ba...Bas... Bastard builds a mansion, fills it with books and antiques. He invites Japanese collectors to his library, holds readings of rare books, and auctions the books off. He loves books and paintings like his own flesh, but he can't help parting with a few. What to do, when he must sell, but can't bear to? He sells a fake. He seeks out a specialist to create intricate forgeries. (JP) Unlike him this specialist... is a real Japanese, of noble birth! (JP) Count Fujiwara from Nagoya. So, who is this? It's the wife. His Japanese wife. - You'll seduce her... - Is she pretty? The Jap wife died ages ago with no children. But the dead wife's dead sister's living daughter performs those book readings. But is she pretty? An orphan. Her father was rich. Soon she'll fall in love with me, and we'll elope to Japan. After marrying her there, and inheriting her fortune, I'll declare her insane and lock her up in a madhouse. Right! Sookee will be my mouse, work as her maid, eavesdrop on her, stay by her side and gently persuade her to fall in love. Love? What does a crook know about love? What of her fortune? She's rich? Each night in bed I think of her assets. 1.5 million in cash. 300,000 in bonds. The uncle is just a guardian. It's Hideko's fortune. That's why Kouzuki schemes to marry the girl. To his w...wife's niece? What a s...sick f...f... Right, a sick fuck. So what's our share? I'll share 50,000 Sookee gets the dresses and jewellery. (JP) I'll do it! Take me! (JP) My Japanese is better, and I worked as a maid! On top of the fifty, I get dresses, jewellery and my own 100,000. She must be crazy... Crazy? Not a bit. I'll take my fortune and flee this country. Endure these country yokels a bit longer. Those fuckers. (JP) This is Tamako. (JP) I am at your service.",

Nothing made her happier than when guests praised her baby's scent. You are my Baby Miss. Auntie gave the babies candy during baths. To teach them that bath time is sweet. What's Wrong? One of my teeth is sharp. It keeps cutting me. So this was the scent. All smooth. (JP) Welcome, sir! (JP) You are too kind to greet me this way upon my arrival, (JP) when the journey has left me so unkempt. (JP) Now your tedium is over. (JP) I'll ensure your painting lessons are stimulating. (JP) This must be Okju. (JP) At your service, mi lord. (JP) You know if you fail, it'll put me in an awkward position? (JP) A decent bone structure for a Korean... (JP) So, are you carrying out your duties faithfully? (JP) Count Fujiwara requests Miss Hideko to kindly allow her maid Tamako (JP) to be sent to his Lordship for a brief errand. (JP) Did you call for me, mi lord? (JP) You may enter. Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo. How you'll be an even greater thief than your mum. Who believes the talk of a swindler? When I give the signal, \"fully ripe\", arrange for her and I to be alone. Then I'll gobble her up to the pit. She's so naive, even if a man pulls on her nipples she won't know what he wants. So it's your job to tell her that everything is because of me. (JP) \"Oh my, since the Count arrived,\" (JP) \"your toenails are growing much faster!\" That sort of thing, all right? Here, a gift. Oh, he's so thoughtful! That'll be mine when she goes to the madhouse. It pains my heart to see this poor girl. Have you ever seen sapphires so blue? Let's take a look... This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel. It's all right, Miss. Spinels are expensive too. How do you know... Oh, my Auntie...l mean, Lady Minami taught me. But it's fine! No need to be ashamed at all. Your average fence can barely tell them apart. Is that so? Of all the things I've washed and dressed, has anything been this pretty? I'd like to show her to the people at home. What would they say? Probably this? (JP) Mesmerizing! (JP) S...Spellbindingly beautiful! He's shameless. B...b...beautiful! L...l...I'm flummoxed in your presence! If you stutter like that and make your face go red, those uppity bitches will feel superior, and then they'll open up to you, all right?",

One of my teeth is sharp. It keeps cutting me. So this was the scent. All smooth.  Welcome, sir!  You are too kind to greet me this way upon my arrival,  when the journey has left me so unkempt.  Now your tedium is over.  I'll ensure your painting lessons are stimulating.  This must be Okju.  At your service, mi lord.  You know if you fail, it'll put me in an awkward position?  A decent bone structure for a Korean...  So, are you carrying out your duties faithfully?  Count Fujiwara requests Miss Hideko to kindly allow her maid Tamako  to be sent to his Lordship for a brief errand.  Did you call for me, mi lord?  You may enter. Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo. How you'll be an even greater thief than your mum. Who believes the talk of a swindler? When I give the signal, \"fully ripe\", arrange for her and I to be alone. Then I'll gobble her up to the pit. She's so naive, even if a man pulls on her nipples she won't know what he wants. So it's your job to tell her that everything is because of me.  \"Oh my, since the Count arrived,\"  \"your toenails are growing much faster!\" That sort of thing, all right? Here, a gift. Oh, he's so thoughtful! That'll be mine when she goes to the madhouse. It pains my heart to see this poor girl. Have you ever seen sapphires so blue? Let's take a look... This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel. It's all right, Miss. Spinels are expensive too. How do you know... Oh, my Auntie...l mean, Lady Minami taught me. But it's fine! No need to be ashamed at all. Your average fence can barely tell them apart. Is that so? Of all the things I've washed and dressed, has anything been this pretty? I'd like to show her to the people at home. What would they say? Probably this?  Mesmerizing!  S...Spellbindingly beautiful! He's shameless. B...b...beautiful! L...l...I'm flummoxed in your presence! If you stutter like that and make your face go red, those uppity bitches will feel superior, and then they'll open up to you, all right?"

What's with her? Why does she stomp her feet, expressing her anger, sit up in the middle of the night and sigh? Every time she sees the Count, her eyes seem to say, I despise you. Try to bear it. Only if she sees this will she believe the proposal. Think of me as that puppet, and I'll imagine another woman. What woman? The duchess Juliette.  Lady!  Mi lord! Lady...  \"The lady's emotions lay deep inside...  \"Jinlian could not fathom their depths.  \"Knowing this, Lady Sun  \"gave Jinlian four small silver balls.  \"These are 'minling', or 'bells of passion.'  \"Place two in the lady's Jade Gate,  \"and the other two in yours.  \"Spread your legs apart  \"and like two scissors  \"trying to cut each other, put them together."

(JP) Miss Nam Sookee? (JP) Mr. Go Pandol? (JP) You need to pay an additional 3 yen. (JP) All right. I'm just an old man who likes dirty stories. Even listening to the same story, people imagine different things. Peering into each of those fantasies was this old man's humble recreation. What to do, now that it's all over? You should at least tell me your story. How did that bitch Hideko taste? Was she fully ripe? Tell me. A cigarette might help my memory. Right, right... You have that silly penchant for cigarettes? So how was Hideko? You have no windows here? Sookee could be listening in. Let's do our best. That's it, good. What's this? You can't stop there, dear fellow. So, where did you touch first? Her face? Her breasts? Or straight for her c...cunt? Was it soft? Did it tighten up? Did it have many wrinkles? Was it sufficiently wet? The viscosity and transparency of her vaginal secretion? Please, one more cigarette, sir. \"Spider thread pulled into strings...\" I dare say no book has ever described such a ferocious wedding night. I thought I heard a nightingale sing. And...the clear, bright crimson blood! Thus the Lady became my wife. Coy one moment, bold the next... But how was she coy, how was she bold, tell it to me in detail! A story is all about the journey. You should know. Did she resist? So did you pinch her ass as punishment? Or did she spit at you in contempt? Or else... Did she beg you to do it? Like the lady in 'The Widow's Lapdog?' How dare you! Hideko is my wife. What kind of scoundrel rattles on about his wedding night! It's odd.. Your smoke. It's cold, blue... (JP) and strangely beautiful. You too have become soft, slow and dull. Mercury is most deadly in its gaseous state. One cigarette would have sufficed. At least I will die with my cock intact. THE HANDMAIDEN \"I hear a sound in the distance \"That sounds like the steps of my love \"An echo that makes my heart skip a beat \"But I wait all through the night \"and my love never comes to me \"There is no end to the heartache that grips me in this hour \"Waiting for the footsteps of my dear love \"Waiting for the footsteps of my dear love \"But then in my waiting heart \"suddenly happiness overflows \"There you are in the distance \"coming to me \"Filled with dreams of a new life \"filled with happiness \"inside my waiting heart \"flowers start to bloom \"Come my lover, come to me \"I missed you so \"Let's dream of happy times \"like long ago \"Filled with dreams of a new life \"filled with happiness \"inside my waiting heart \"flowers start to bloom \"Waiting for the footsteps of my dear love \"Waiting for the footsteps of my dear love\"",
