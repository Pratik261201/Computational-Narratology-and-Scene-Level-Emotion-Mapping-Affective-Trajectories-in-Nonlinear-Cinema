The way they do in movies and romance novels... where beautiful people learn beautiful lessons... where nothing is too messed up that can't be fixed... with an apology and a Peter Gabriel song. I like that version as much as the next girl does, believe me. It's just not the truth. This is the truth. Sorry. Late in the winter of my seventeenth year... my mother decided that I was depressed. She just eats like a bird, she barely leaves the house. I am not depressed, Mom. She's reading the same book over and over. She's depressed. I'm not depressed. The booklets and the websites always list depression as a side effect of cancer. Depression's not a side effect of cancer. It's a side effect of dying. Which is what was happening to me. I may switch you to Zoloft. Or Lexapro. And twice a day instead of once. - Why stop there? - Hmm? Really, just keep them coming. I'm like the Keith Richards of cancer kids. Have you been going to that support group I suggested? Yeah, it's not my thing. Support groups can be a great way for you to connect with people who are... Who are... What? on the same journey. \"Journey\"? Really? Give it a chance. Who knows, you might even find it enlightening. All right. Are you guys ready? We are gathered here today literally in the heart of Jesus. We're here with J.C. Who wants to share their story with the group? I'm Angel. I have acute myeloid leukemia. Sid. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Hi, I'm PJ. Um, I have neuroblastoma. I'm Patrick. Testicular. I'll spare you the gory details of Patrick's ball cancer. Basically, they found it in his nuts... they cut most of it out, and he almost died, but he didn't die. So now, here he is, divorced, friendless... living on his parents' couch... exploiting his cancer-tastic past in the heart of Jesus. Literally. To show us that one day, if we're lucky... we could be just like him. Who's next? Hazel? Um... I'm Hazel. Uh, thyroid, originally... but now with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs. And how are you doing? Uh, you mean besides the terminal cancer? All right, I guess. We're here for you, Hazel. Why don't I play another song? Christ is our friend And he'll be there till the end Christ is our friend And he'll be there till the end Christ Hey, sweet pea.",

Hey, guys. Uh... Hi, I'm Isaac. I have retinoblastoma. We had surgery on one eye when I was younger... so this is a glass eye. And then I'm going in to the hospital to have another surgery... to take out the other eye. So, after that surgery, I'm just gonna be totally blind. But I'm lucky, because I have this beautiful, smoking hot girlfriend... who's way out of my league. Monica. And I have great friends like Augustus Waters to help me out. So, that's what's up. Thanks. We're here for you, Isaac. Thank you. Your turn, Gus. Yeah, sure. Um, I'm Augustus Waters. I'm 18 years old and I had a touch of osteosarcoma about a year-and-a-half ago.

No, I mean now. You could be an axe murderer. There's always that possibility. Come on, Hazel Grace. Take a risk. I don't... Really? That is disgusting. What?

And yours is even though you had freaking cancer... you're willing to give money to a corporation... for the chance to acquire even more cancer? Let me just tell you that not being able to breathe sucks! It totally sucks. \"Hamartia\"? It's a fatal flaw. Ah, a fatal... Hazel Grace, they don't actually hurt you unless you light them. Hmm? I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see? You put the thing that does the killing right between your teeth... but you never give it the power to kill you. A metaphor. Hey, sweetheart. Is it Top Model time? No. Uh... I've made plans with Augustus Waters. Whoa! Oh, my God. Ooh! Yeah, I failed my test a couple times. You don't say. Actually, the fourth time I took the test, it was going about how this is going. And when it was over... the instructor looks over at me, and she says... \"Your driving, while unpleasant, is not technically unsafe.\" Cancer perk. Total cancer perk. So, tell me about you. Um, I was 13 when they found it. Pretty much worst-case scenario. Thyroid, stage four. Not much they could do. Which didn't stop them, of course. Surgery. Radiation. Chemo. More radiation. All of which worked for a while. But, then stopped working. And then one day, my lungs started filling up with water. Nurse! We need a nurse right now! I couldn't breathe. No one could get it under control. You can let go, sweetie. Don't be afraid. That should have been the end. Oh, my God. But then something strange happened. The antibiotics kicked in. They drained the fluid from my lungs. I got some strength back. Next thing I know, I found myself in an experimental trial. You know, the ones that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for not working. It's called Phalanxifor. It didn't work in over 70% of the patients... but for some reason it's been working for me. So, they called it \"The Miracle.\" Of course, my lungs still suck at being lungs... but, theoretically, they could continue to suck like this... for, I don't know, a while maybe. So, are you back in school? I got my GED, so I'm taking classes at MCC. Whoa! A college girl! Well, that explains the aura of sophistication. Oh! Careful! Oops. Welcome to my humble abode. Uh, my folks call them \"encouragements.\" Don't ask.",

I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see? You put the thing that does the killing right between your teeth... but you never give it the power to kill you. A metaphor. Hey, sweetheart. Is it Top Model time? No. Uh... I've made plans with Augustus Waters. Whoa! Oh, my God. Ooh! Yeah, I failed my test a couple times. You don't say. Actually, the fourth time I took the test, it was going about how this is going. And when it was over... the instructor looks over at me, and she says... \"Your driving, while unpleasant, is not technically unsafe.\" Cancer perk. Total cancer perk. So, tell me about you. Um, I was 13 when they found it. Pretty much worst-case scenario. Thyroid, stage four. Not much they could do. Which didn't stop them, of course. Surgery. Radiation. Chemo. More radiation. All of which worked for a while. But, then stopped working. And then one day, my lungs started filling up with water. Nurse! We need a nurse right now! I couldn't breathe. No one could get it under control. You can let go, sweetie. Don't be afraid. That should have been the end. Oh, my God. But then something strange happened. The antibiotics kicked in. They drained the fluid from my lungs. I got some strength back. Next thing I know, I found myself in an experimental trial. You know, the ones that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for not working. It's called Phalanxifor. It didn't work in over 70% of the patients... but for some reason it's been working for me. So, they called it \"The Miracle.\" Of course, my lungs still suck at being lungs... but, theoretically, they could continue to suck like this... for, I don't know, a while maybe. So, are you back in school? I got my GED, so I'm taking classes at MCC. Whoa! A college girl! Well, that explains the aura of sophistication. Oh! Careful! Oops. Welcome to my humble abode. Uh, my folks call them \"encouragements.\" Don't ask."

The only way I could ever authorize a trip like this would be if someone familiar with your case... What if my mom came? Wait, what? What if you came? I'm... I'm sure the Genies would hook it up. They're loaded. That just might work. And then this happened. Hey. Hi. - Hey. - You're okay. So, what happened? The usual. Fluid in the lungs preventing oxygenation. They put a tube in. They drained a liter and a half last night. The good news is... no tumor growth. No new tumors in your body. We're so relieved. This is just a thing, Hazel. It's a thing we can live with. Mr. Lancaster. How's she doing? Better. Yeah, thank you. Much, much better. Uh, they won't let me in. It's family only. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I get it. Um... Could you just tell her I was here? Yeah, of course. Of course I will. - Okay. - Gus, listen, why don't you go home? Get some rest. Okay. Normally, the tumors start resisting the treatment... and that hasn't happened here... Yet. On the other hand... the drug may be worsening the edema. The truth is... very few people have been on Phalanxifor as long as Hazel has. We really don't know the long-term effects. What we're trying to do is prevent endothelial growth... which, when overexpressed, can contribute to disease, decay... vascular inhibition... and the spread of the tumors we're working so hard to eradicate. The survival rate of patients with severe endothelial growth... decreases exponentially the more the condition advances. You can let go, sweetie. Don't be afraid. Oh, my God. I'm not gonna be a mom anymore. I have a question. Yes, Hazel? Can I still go to Amsterdam? - That would not be wise at this juncture. - Why not? Is there any way we can make that trip happen? It would increase some risks. But so does going to the mall. Yes, but an airplane? But they have oxygen on airplanes. You're stage four.",

Oh, my God, we're flying. We're flying! Look at the ground! Look. Nothing has ever looked like this in all of human history! Look at the cars. They're like... You two are so adorable. We're just friends. Well, she is, I'm not. Oh, my! Whoa! Get away from her, you bitch! Look at this, Hazel. This is so crazy. Whoa. What? Look at the stained glass. It's amazing. Oh, I'm gonna check us in. We better get you dressed... because you have reservations for two tonight, - for dinner at Oranjee. - Oh. And it says, \"Enjoy. Mr. Peter Van Houten.\" So, I looked it up and it sounds amazing. The guide book says it's fancy and very romantic. Right. Fancy... Oh, God. But, okay, what... will you wear? Is that for me? Oh, my God. It's so beautiful. I'm just saying. You're just saying? What, you're saying that you're totally fine... with your teenage daughter running free with an older boy... in a city that's famous for its vice and debauchery is totally fine with you? Yeah, that's pretty much exactly what I'm saying. Gus! Oh, you look so handsome! - Thank you, ma'am. - Wow. Hazel, Gus is here... looking incredible! I hear this restaurant is unbelievable. Wow. What? You look gorgeous. Thanks. Whoa! Wow. This is it. Oranjee. Yeah, this is it. Oh, yeah. Your table, Mr. and Mrs. Waters. Thank you. Thanks, Gus. You are very welcome. The champagne is our gift. Enjoy. Thank you. Good evening. Voilà. - Okay? - Okay. Whoa. That is amazing. Do you know what Dom Pérignon said after he invented champagne? \"Come quickly,\" he said. \"I'm tasting the stars.\" Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like a menu, or will you have the chef's choice? Chef's choice sounds wonderful. - Mmm. - And, sir, um... something tells me we're gonna need a little bit more of this. We have bottled all the stars for you this evening, my young friends."

The only member of the Frank family to survive was Otto. Anne's father. At such moments... I can't think about the misery... but about the beauty that still remains. Try to recapture the happiness within yourself. Think of all the beauty in everything around you... and be happy. Bravo. I fell in love with him the way you fall asleep.

Every second, worse than the last. One of the first things they ask you in the ER... is to rate your pain on a scale from one to ten. I've been asked this question hundreds of times... and I remember once... when I couldn't catch my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire... the nurse asked me to rate the pain. Though I couldn't speak, I held up nine fingers. Later, when I started feeling better... the nurse came in and she called me a fighter. \"You know how I know?\" she said. \"You called a ten a nine.\" But that wasn't the truth. I didn't call it a nine because I was brave. The reason I called it a nine was because I was saving my ten. And this was it. This was the great and terrible ten. \"I will fear no evil, for You are with me... \"Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. \"You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. \"You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows. \"Surely, goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life... \"and I will dwell in the house of the Lord... \"forever.\" Augustus Waters fought hard for many years. His battle was a courageous one, and his strength... What a load of shit, huh, kid? was a source of inspiration for each and every one of us. Let us pray.

I love you, too. Augustus Waters died eight days later in the ICU. When the cancer, which was made of him... stopped his heart, which was also made of him. It was unbearable. The whole thing. Every second, worse than the last. One of the first things they ask you in the ER... is to rate your pain on a scale from one to ten. I've been asked this question hundreds of times... and I remember once... when I couldn't catch my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire... the nurse asked me to rate the pain. Though I couldn't speak, I held up nine fingers. Later, when I started feeling better... the nurse came in and she called me a fighter. \"You know how I know?\" she said. \"You called a ten a nine.\" But that wasn't the truth. I didn't call it a nine because I was brave. The reason I called it a nine was because I was saving my ten. And this was it. This was the great and terrible ten. \"I will fear no evil, for You are with me... \"Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. \"You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. \"You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows. \"Surely, goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life... \"and I will dwell in the house of the Lord... \"forever.\" Augustus Waters fought hard for many years. His battle was a courageous one, and his strength... What a load of shit, huh, kid? was a source of inspiration for each and every one of us. Let us pray. We thank You, Lord, for the life of Augustus Waters..."

Thank You for Your presence, Lord. All this we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Now, we are going to hear from Gus' special friend... Hazel Lancaster. Not that it really matters, but I was his girlfriend. There's a beautiful quote in Gus' home that reads... \"If you want the rainbow, you have to deal with the rain.\" Even in his last few days... Um... I didn't believe a word. He was always able to crack a smile. But that's okay. I knew this was the right thing to do. Funerals, I'd decided, are not for the dead. They're for the living. Hey, want some company? No, I'm okay. I'm just gonna drive for a bit by myself. Love you. Love you. You spoke beautifully. I'll see you soon. Drive safe. Okay. May I? Omnis cellula e cellula. Your boy Waters and I corresponded quite a bit in his last days. Oh. So, you read your fan mail now? I wouldn't exactly call him a fan. He detested me. But he was quite insistent I attend his funeral... and tell you what became of Anna and her mother... so here I am. And that's your answer, \"Omnis cellula e cellula.\" \"Life comes from life.\" I'm really not in the mood. You don't want an explanation? No, I don't. Thank you, though. Have a great life. You remind me of her. I remind a lot of people of a lot of people. My daughter was eight. And she suffered beautifully for so long. She had leukemia like Anna? Just like Anna. I'm very sorry for your loss. And I'm sorry for yours. And sorry for ruining your trip. You didn't ruin our trip. We had an amazing trip. Are you familiar with the Trolley Problem? There's a thought experiment in the field of ethics... known as the Trolley Problem. Philippa Foot was an English philosopher... Oh, my God. Hazel, I'm trying to explain something to you. I'm trying to give you what you wanted. No, you're not! You are a drunk, and you're a failure... and I need you to get out of my car right now... so that I can go home, and be by myself and grieve! You'll want to read this. I don't want to read anything. Can you just get out of my car? Please get out of my car! Fine. Can I come in? I'm so, so sorry. Yeah.
