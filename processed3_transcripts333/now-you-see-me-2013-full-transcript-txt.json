That's too obvious. Pay close attention. That was too fast. I'll do it again. Are you ready? Okay. - Now did you see one? - Yes. - Do you have one in mind? - Yes. Now, do you see your card here? No. That's because you're looking too closely. And what have I been telling you all night? The closer you look... The less you see. Now look into my eyes. And sleep. Okay. And... If you can get this bill from me, you can have it. Go ahead. Take it. Get it. If you can say your name, you can have it. All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec. I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood -of your hubby's brain. - Oh, no, no, no. I'm picturing... - Don't tell me. - Of course. Beach. Cocktails. Florida? Look, it was a business trip. I mean, it is a kind of business. Maybe the oldest business. You know what, Honey Bee, let's... She can't move, Mack. You're thinking of a woman's name. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J... J? Jean. Jane. Janet. Who's Janet? You know Janet? It's not your best friend, is it? - Your sister? - No, please. Her sister? Oh, my God. You weren't away on business. - You were away on Janet. - No. Your wife's sister! Okay. Now she's gonna get upset. Let's move over here. You want this to go away? - Yes. - Okay, pull out your wallet. Come on, get it out. Do you shake down everybody like this? No, only the special few. What is this? Two hundred seem fair? You know what? This is a big deal. Let's go $250. You're a stick-up artist. Yeah. Of course. Okay, and sleep! Now, when I snap my fingers, you won't remember any of this. And you, Warren Beatty, every time you see or even think of Janet, you're gonna picture me naked. And that's not a pretty sight. Yeah. And... You're wide awake! Well, we did the best we could, but some people just aren't to be hypnotized. - I did it wrong? - Come on, Honey Bee. - Oh, no, you did it fine. - Let me buy you dinner. Look after her. Just have to hit an ATM first. Ladies and gentlemen, I am the next great magician, and I will give $100 to anyone who can tell me how this trick is done. I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli, right here in Brooklyn. Check it out.",

Nice wallet. You have a very good eye, sir. Thanks. Wallet. My wallet. My watch! Stop that guy! Stop that guy in the leather jacket! He's got my wallet! Okay, Los Angeles, are we ready to end this thing? Yeah! When that timer hits zero, a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas will fall from above. A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls? One, two, three! Yeah! Help! Stop it! She's serious! She can't get out! Go get some help! Help, dude! Get out of the way! Move! Move! Come on! This is bullshit! Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist! Yes! I am your biggest fan. I could tell by the way you're attacking my face right now. Close the door. Bad apartment building. - Magician, come here. - Okay. - Wait, wait. - What? What? How did you do that... The seven of diamonds on the side of the tower? - Yes. - That's a trade secret. I'll give you a hint. It involved bribing the tower electrician. How much? 50 bucks. - But it's so hard. - Oh, thank you. Is it always a seven? I could do that trick 52 different ways. Can you do 52 different tricks on me? I'll see what I can do. Magic man! I love your shampoo. - Hold up. - What? You need to leave. Are you kidding me? Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing. Is this what you do? Some kind of sick trick you do to women? \"45 East Evan Street.\" Don't worry about it. I'll call you. You don't have my number. I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night. You are such an asshole. Hey! Henley. Danny? Hey. You got a card, huh? No, no, no, it's good for you. Congratulations. All right, so here's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go inside. I'm gonna scope the place out. You wait out here. I will come back and get you, okay? Do not come in. Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore. Nice hair. So, actually, what have you been up to? I think you know exactly what I've been up to, Danny. I saw all your anonymous posting on my website. You have a website. That's good. Good for you. Get the word out. Okay.

It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out. You are a control freak. Well, I take that as a compliment. Only he would take it as a compliment. Good. Another compliment.

No. I said that one time because of the trap door. No one could fit through there. No one. Rebecca fit through. Rebecca fit for years. Do you know how hard it is to stay in those tiny little costumes? No. I'm the main attraction. Okay. So he never made you feel special. And, trust me, you deserve to be made to feel special. That's a really nice story. Hope you guys enjoy each other's company. No way. J. Daniel Atlas? Dude, I've seen everything that you have ever done. You're like... I idolize you. Seriously.

Are we waiting for someone? - Why are we just... - The door's locked. Oh, no, nothing's ever locked. What is this place? Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty. Man, it's freezing in here. What's that? I don't know. What's it say? \"Now you don't.\" \"A rose by any other name...\" Guys, what's happening? Look at that. It's gas! Relax. Just dry ice. Cool. Wait. What do you think this is all about?

I don't know, but I really want to meet them. It's a show. Merritt McKinney, Daniel Atlas, Henley Reeves, Jack Wilder. Arthur Tressler and the MGM Grand proudly presents The Four Horsemen. Thank you. Tonight we would like to try something that will, well, set us a bit apart. For our final trick, we're gonna do something never before seen on a Las Vegas stage. Or any stage for that matter. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we are going to rob a bank. That's a lot of excitement for a crime. I'm getting excited. What about you, people? One, two, three! Sorry, sir. There's absolutely no recording allowed during the performance. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course. Let me just put this away. Actually, I need to take that. After the show, I can come and give it back to you. Okay. Okay, okay. Now, please, please, settle down. Now who here has a bank they would like us to rob? That's a lot of people with a vendetta. So we'll choose one at random then. My associates will make sure it's random. Right? - Elvis, help me out, bud. - Thank you very much. In Jack's bowl are ping pong balls with section numbers. Jack, could you hand me a section number? Thank you. We are looking at Section B. Where is Section B? Okay. There. It's gonna be one of you guys. Get ready. I don't know why everybody's happy.

Where are you? Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi. Could you just confirm for me that this is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13. Yes. Okay. Wonderful. Now, could you please tell us your name and the name of your bank? Well, my name is Etienne Forcier. And my bank, it's Credit Republicain de Paris. French. Okay. We were hoping for something a little more local, a kind of mom-and-pop credit union with no security. But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

I don't know, but I really want to meet them. It's a show. Merritt McKinney, Daniel Atlas, Henley Reeves, Jack Wilder. Arthur Tressler and the MGM Grand proudly presents The Four Horsemen. Thank you. Tonight we would like to try something that will, well, set us a bit apart. For our final trick, we're gonna do something never before seen on a Las Vegas stage. Or any stage for that matter. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we are going to rob a bank. That's a lot of excitement for a crime. I'm getting excited. What about you, people? One, two, three! Sorry, sir. There's absolutely no recording allowed during the performance. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course. Let me just put this away. Actually, I need to take that. After the show, I can come and give it back to you. Okay. Okay, okay. Now, please, please, settle down. Now who here has a bank they would like us to rob? That's a lot of people with a vendetta. So we'll choose one at random then. My associates will make sure it's random. Right? - Elvis, help me out, bud. - Thank you very much. In Jack's bowl are ping pong balls with section numbers. Jack, could you hand me a section number? Thank you. We are looking at Section B. Where is Section B? Okay. There. It's gonna be one of you guys. Get ready. I don't know why everybody's happy.

Now, Etienne, let's step into this cockamamie contraption. And I'll step off of it. Bonne chance. It's 11 :50 p.m. here in Vegas. That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris. Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

So, if you had nothing to do with it, then how did the playing card get into the vault? Oh, yes. That would be... What do the kids call it these days? Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

Using magic and illusion to even the scales of justice. Are The Horsemen next in a long line of fools to believe this myth? Will they evade the rules of law and logic like they did in Las Vegas? Or will the dark mysticism of this Southern swampland get the better of them? Bravo, Mr. Bradley. Either you have a cease-and-desist, which you don't, or you should leave. If I want something to cease or desist, it does. Take five. According to your potential backers, you stand to make 2.5 million tops from your best special. I have here a check for 3.5 million. To walk away? To fly away. My jet is at your disposal. Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler. You're in this to ride them up. I'm in it to ride them down. I take it that we do not have a deal. And therein lies our conflict. Let me be blunt. My bank account is much, much bigger than yours. And my lawyers are much stronger. And they will manacle you with so many injunctions.

There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts. Sometimes in the mornings I sit on a bench there. And I watch the people make a wish and lock it in a lock on the bridge. Then throw the key into the Seine. All day they do this. Mothers, lovers, old men. Watching the key sink into the water and their secret is locked away forever. Real and, at the same time, magical. So, do you really think it's possible there's a fifth Horseman? Yeah. There is a legend of a secret order born in ancient Egypt called \"The Eye. \" It is said they perfected sleight of hand to steal food from the Pharaohs and give it to the slaves. Their purpose? Using magic and illusion to even the scales of justice. Are The Horsemen next in a long line of fools to believe this myth? Will they evade the rules of law and logic like they did in Las Vegas? Or will the dark mysticism of this Southern swampland get the better of them? Bravo, Mr. Bradley. Either you have a cease-and-desist, which you don't, or you should leave. If I want something to cease or desist, it does. Take five. According to your potential backers, you stand to make 2.5 million tops from your best special. I have here a check for 3.5 million. To walk away? To fly away. My jet is at your disposal. Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler. You're in this to ride them up. I'm in it to ride them down. I take it that we do not have a deal. And therein lies our conflict. Let me be blunt. My bank account is much, much bigger than yours. And my lawyers are much stronger. And they will manacle you with so many injunctions. Until you stand by, hopelessly watching everything that you own drain away in front of your greedy little eyes."

I didn't ask you. I asked him. The money's in a vault inside a warehouse in Queens. We think this vault is your magicians' final target. The magician who died on the bridge... You pulled our classified Elkhorn file right from his crispy little hand. And despite their bullshit Robin Hood razzle-dazzle, your magicians are nothing more than common thieves. How did they get the file? This is the part you're gonna find particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.",

Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool. Let's just drop the theatricality, all right? The cameras aren't rolling in here. Fellas, can I have a few minutes with my friend here alone, please.

Well, when I first met you, I thought you were kind of a dick. And? No, that's it. That's very nice. - Yeah. - I'm touched. Yeah. Just from the heart. Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched. Oh, you! Oh, God. What are we gonna do when this is over? We're on our own. Our instructions run out after the show. Even if there is no \"Eye,\" if we were completely played and we spend the next 20 years in jail, then, I just want to say that... I know. Me, too. Little too sentimental for me. There they are! Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go! Grab 'em! Get up! What the hell? Shit! Hello, New York! Thank you for the magic. And thank you for being such an incredible and dedicated audience. Unfortunately, like all good things, it must come to an end. So we would like to start our show tonight... By saying goodbye. All we wanted was to bring the world to a magic show. And thereby bring a little magic back to the world. Clear the way! This has been one hell of a ride for all of us. But it's time for us to disappear. Good night, New York. And thank you for believing in us. Stop! Freeze! No! God damn it! I'm sorry. You were right. It's bigger than all of us. This is one time I'm not happy being right. So I guess this is it. Is it? Dylan! Dylan! Dylan! Hey. - You see that? - What? Where's the real money? You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now! I've been framed. I'm sure you were. Yeah, but I can prove it. I always do. Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool. Let's just drop the theatricality, all right? The cameras aren't rolling in here. Fellas, can I have a few minutes with my friend here alone, please. Sure. All right. I got information to trade. I believe that's how it's done. Huh? If it's of some value. These bars give a man time to think. And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it."

After gaining access to the warehouse, The Horsemen left the real safe and transformed the whole room into a giant rabbit box. You go charging in there, thinking the safe was already gone. Hey! Hey! Stop! Missing the trick. Again. Which was to make you think the safe had already been stolen, so you'd drop your guard and leave. Now, while you were busy playing with balloon animals, someone was breaking into the warehouse. Who? Jack Wilder. Holy shit. No. No way. He died right in front of my eyes. Unless, of course, he didn't. It's locked. Weren't you listening? Nothing's ever locked. Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work. You're a big boy now, Jack. He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right? Led you to the bridge. Where the other Horsemen were waiting with an identical replacement car. It only took a split second for you to lose contact with it and make the switch.

The insurer who denied the family's claim? Tressler Insurance. The bank that carried the note? Credit Republican of Paris. Credit Republicain de Paris. What do you make of that?

That? The Lionel Shrike tree. And the card encased in glass. What do we do now? Oh, nice! So, here's my new theory. The legend is that the \"Eye\" is everywhere. Waiting for the truly great magicians to distinguish themselves from the mediocre ones. Maybe that was you. Deep down inside you wanted nothing more than to be part of the \"Eye,\" but you were never invited. So you try to destroy them.",
