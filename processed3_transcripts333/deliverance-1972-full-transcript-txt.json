They're gonna flood a whole valley, Bobby, that's why. Damn it, they're drowning the river. They're drowning the river, man. All right, man, all right. All right. We're talking to you. All right. Just about the last wild, untamed, unpolluted... ...unfucked-up river in the South. Don't you understand what I'm saying? They're gonna stop the river up. There ain't gonna be no more river. Just gonna be a big dead lake. - That's progress. - That ain't progress, that's shit. It's a very clean way of making electric power. Those lakes up there provide people with recreation... I don't give a shit. My father-in-law has a houseboat on Lake Bowie. That's a nice place too. You just push a little more... You push a little more power into Atlanta... ...a little more air conditioners for your smug little suburb... ...and you know what's gonna happen? We're gonna rape this whole damn landscape. - We're gonna rape it. - Oh, Lewis. My... That's an extreme point of view, Lewis. It is. Extremist. We're gonna leave Friday from Atlanta. I'm gonna have you back in your little suburban house... ...in time to see the football game on Sunday afternoon. I know you... You'll be back in time to see the pompom girls at halftime... ...because I know that's all you care about. Listen... Listen, Lewis, I'm gonna thank you. - You are gonna thank me. - I'm gonna thank you. Are there any hillbillies up here anymore, Lewis? Yeah, there's some people up there that ain't ever seen a town before... ...no bigger than Aintry, anyway. Them... Those woods are real deep. The river's inaccessible, except at a couple of points. How we gonna get there, Lewis? - Well, cancel my tickets... - I'm gonna take you there. Well, what the hell do you know about canoeing for Christ's sakes? I know enough about canoeing to handle the both of you. Oh, man. I don't know what that means, but I'll go along. Lewis... - You better... - We're into it. This is the last chance we got to see this river. You just wait until you feel that white water on you. - Ain't that right? Tell him about that. - I don't know if I'm ready. I don't know, but I'm willing.",

Look, come here a minute. See that car there? See that car down there? We want somebody to drive them down to Aintry for us. Hell, you're crazy. No shit. Hey, come here.

I wanna get some drivers to drive this car... ...and that car down to Aintry. Drivers, you understand? You might get the Griner brothers. - Who? - The Griner brothers. Where do they live? They live back over that way. - Four ninety-nine. - Right. Talk about genetic deficiencies. Isn't that pitiful? Who's picking the banjo here? Come on, I'm with you. I'm lost. Ahoo! Goddamn, I could play all day with that guy! I believe you could too. I believe you could. - That's good. - That's very good, sir. Goddamn, you play a mean banjo. Hey, you... You wanna play another one? Give him a couple of bucks. - Can that chubby boy handle himself? - Who? Bobby? He's rather well thought of in his field, Lewis. Insurance? Shit. I never been insured in my life. I don't believe in insurance. There's no risk. I have some. Ed. Over here. Shit. Fuck. God almighty. Anything we can do for you? No. It ain't as bad as I thought. Your name Griner? What do you wanna know for? Can you and your brother drive two cars down to Aintry for us? Drive them down there for what? Me and my buddy here, we're gonna take a canoe trip down the Cahulawassee. We'd like to have them cars in Aintry when we get there. Be there about Sunday noon.",

You're gonna kill us both, you son of a bitch... ...before we ever see any water. - Slow it down, Lewis, come on. - Here we go. Come on, don't fool around. Listen, Ed. Listen. Yeah. Sometimes you have to lose yourself before you can find anything. Any snakes around here? This is the one. There she is. Looks good. Looks good. Couple more months, and she'll all be gone. Even up as far as here? - Ed! - From Aintry on up. Lewis! One big dead lake. Over here! Hey, couldn't we have found a harder place to get in? - Oh, this is steep here now. - All right. - Watch yourself. - I'm watching. You're losing glass on your bow. Whoo, it's freezing. - Hell, it'll hold. - Mm-hm. What in the hell are we gonna do... ...if we come off this river, and our cars are not at what's-its-name? They'll be there. Well, they're pretty rough-looking boys. You can't judge people by the way they look, chubby. You can trust them. I'm going with you, Ed, and not with Mr. Lewis Medlock.

Like to went up the river without my oar, didn't I? Shit. We hit any strong water, instead of bare-assing through it... I'm ready. - Come on. - I'm coming on. I got myself a humdinger here. I think we can save ourselves considerable hardship... ...if we just backwater, talk it out before we make our move. - You got that? - Right. All right, put on your life jacket. - Right. - Here. Which way are we going? I think downstream would be a good idea, don't you? - All right. - Go. You and Bobby see some rocks, you yell out. - Right. - We're supposed to holler \"rocks\"? Lewis, is this the way you get your rocks off? Uh-huh. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Keep your eyes open, Drew. - I'll race you. - Keep your eyes open, Robert. - Come on, come on, come on. Thattaboy, thattaboy. Get with it. Every move you make, call it out. I'm behind you. Right. Here we go. See how fast we can shoot down here. What is this? Is this some fast water we're coming up to? All right, Drew, just get in behind Lewis there. - Look at this. - Let's pick up some speed here. All right, all right, let's go. Just a little, there you have it. - To the left. - Whoo! Hey, now, that didn't hurt too bad, did it? Whoo! I'm with you, Ed. Now you getting it, boy. Very good. Look, Ed. Well, for the Lord's sake, will you look at that? What do we do now? This gonna be fun. Just follow us. Hey, what...? What happens if we flip this thing over? Now that you brought that up, hang on to your paddle. And if you hit any rocks, don't hit them with your head. Watch Lewis. Maybe we can learn something. Backwater now. Oh, yeah. Go right. - Go right, go right. - Yeah.

All right, look. You get up there now. Okay, all right. - Get up there. - All right. Faster, boy. - Move that ass. - Take it easy with that weapon. You, too, shut up. - Come on. Right on back here. - Okay. What's the trouble here? - Oh, you in trouble. - Just don't argue with them, Ed. - See that sapling over yonder? - You heard him. Back up against that. Is this a matter of money? You gentlemen... If we want money, we'll take your money. Back up against the tree. - Put your back against it. - Back against it. All right, stay just there. Now be still. Be real still. If he tries that again, shoot that one there. I'll blow his goddamn balls off. - Now, boy... - You ain't going anywhere, big boy. Be still, now. Now, let's you just drop them pants. - Drop? - Just take them right off. - I mean, what's this all about? - Don't say anything, just do it. Just drop them, boy. You ever had your balls cut off, you fucking ape? Lord. Lookie there. That's sharp. I bet it'd shave a hair."
