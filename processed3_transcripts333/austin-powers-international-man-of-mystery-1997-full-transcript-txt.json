That makes me angry, and when Dr. Evil gets angry... Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset. And when Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset... people die! Why must I be surrounded by frickin' idiots? Mustafa, Frau Farbissina... I spared your lives because I need you... to help me rid the world of Britain's top secret agent... the only man who can stop me now. We must kill Austin Powers! Yeah! Come on, babies. Work with me, people, all right? Show me love. Great, baby! Yeah! Oh, behave. It's Austin Powers! It's Austin Powers! Hello, Mrs. Kensington. Hello, Austin. Why don't you ever model for me, Mrs. Kensington? You know how Mr. Kensington feels about that. Oh, behave. Yeah. Yeah, baby! Yeah! Hello Austin. I'm Basil Exposition with British Intelligence. We have just received word that Dr. Evil... is planning a trap for you tonight... at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club... here in swinging London. We'll be there. There you go. Come on, baby. Yeah! Yeah! Austin, it's a swinging shindig. It's my happening, baby, and it freaks me out! Yeah, man! Can I get you a drink, Mr. Powers? Sure! Austin, we've got to look for Dr. Evil. Wait. I've got an idea. Austin! Why on earth did you hit that woman? Right. Let me show you, baby. That ain't no woman. It's a man, man. It's one of Dr. Evil's assassins. Look out! He's got a knife! Good work, Mrs. Kensington. Alright. Get up! Get up! Right. Where's Dr. Evil? Where is he? There's the bastard. Come on. Let's go. Coming through. Excuse me! I've got you now, Dr. Evil. Not this time. Come, Mr. Bigglesworth! See you in the future, Mr. Powers. My God! He's freezing himself. And so Dr. Evil escaped... and had himself cryogenically frozen... to return at a time when free love no longer reigned... and greed and corruption ruled again. Yes? Commander Gilmour? Speaking. Commander, this is Ritter in Sou-west Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring... and an unorthodox entry angle. What are you saying, son?

I'm having fun!\" Finally, we come to my number-two man. His name... Number Two. For 30 years, Number Two has run Virtucon... the legitimate face of my evil empire. Dr. Evil, over the last 30 years... Virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds. About 15 years ago, we changed from volatile chemicals... to the communications industry. We own cable companies in 38 states. We own a steel mill in Cleveland... shipping in Texas, oil refineries in Seattle... and a factory in Chicago... that makes miniature models of factories.

They're always after me lucky charms. What? Why does everyone always laugh when I say that? They are after me lucky charms! What? It's a television commercial... with this cartoon leprechaun... and all of these children are trying to chase him... \"Hey, leprechaun man! Leprechaun man!\" \"Won't you give your Lucky Charms?\" Oh. And there's all these little tiny bits of marshmallows... just stuck right in the cereal... so that when the kids eat them, they think... \"Oh, this is candy. I'm having fun!\" Finally, we come to my number-two man. His name... Number Two. For 30 years, Number Two has run Virtucon... the legitimate face of my evil empire. Dr. Evil, over the last 30 years... Virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds. About 15 years ago, we changed from volatile chemicals... to the communications industry. We own cable companies in 38 states. We own a steel mill in Cleveland... shipping in Texas, oil refineries in Seattle... and a factory in Chicago... that makes miniature models of factories. Naturally. Gentlemen... I have a plan."

If you want it back, you're going to have to pay me... One million dollars! Sorry. One hundred billion dollars. Gentlemen, silence. Now, Mr. Evil... Dr. Evil. I didn't spend six years in evil medical school to be called \"Mister\", thank you very much. It is the policy of the United Nations... not to negotiate with terrorists. Really? So long. Gentlemen, in exactly five days, we will be $100 billion richer. Hello? Mommy? Hello, Vanessa. And? How's Austin? He's asleep. You didn't. Oh, God! No! No, I made him sleep on the sofa. Vanessa, I'm proud of you. Why? Because you've managed to resist Austin Powers' charms! What? God knows he tried, mommy. I actually had to be rather firm with him. You didn't tell me he is so obsessed with sex! It's really bizarre. You can't judge him by modern standards. What about his teeth? Darling, you have to understand, in Britain in the sixties... you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter. I don't get that, mommy. Once Austin has you in his charms, it's impossible to get out. Did you ever? Me? No, of course not. I was married to your father. You didn't ever want to, did you? Austin is very charming very debonair. He's handsome, witty... has a knowledge of fine wines. He's sophisticated. A world renown photographer. Women want him, and men want to be him. Every bit an international man of mystery. Yeah, but you didn't answer my question, mummy. I know. Let me just say this... Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had. I will always love him. Uh! Ah. Do you want to speak to him? No. It's been too long. Okay, well, now, I'm going to have to go, mummy, but I love you. Ciao, darling. A limo's just pulled up. Let me see. - That's Dr. Evil's cat. - How can you tell? I never forget a pussy... cat. Oh, no. He's gone away. My God, Vanessa, you are so incredibly beautiful. - Oh, no. - That's it. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Hello, Scott. Hello, everybody. So, Scott, why don't we start with you? What brings you here with us today? Well, I just really met my dad for the first time 5 days ago. I was partially frozen his whole life. That is beautiful that you can admit to that. He comes back and... and now he wants me to take over the family business. But, Scott, who's gonna take over the world when I die? Listen to the words he used: \"Who's going to take over the world when I die?\" It feels like that to some of us sometimes, doesn't it? Yes. Yes. So, what do you want to do, Scott? I don't know. I was thinking I like animals. Maybe I'd be a vet. An evil vet? No. Maybe like work in a petting zoo. An evil petting zoo? You always do that!

I've uncovered the details of Project Vulcan. Oh, good God. An underground missile? Austin, where did you find these? Austin did some reconnaissance work last night at Alotta Fagina's penthouse. Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon. Any ideas? Oh, yes. Virtucon runs a tour of its facility every hour. I thought, perhaps, we could disguise ourselves as tourists and do some on-site reconnaissance. Top drawer, Kensington. Oh, er... Austin, I'd like you to meet somebody. This is my mother... Mrs. Exposition. How do you do? Austin! My God, man, what have you done? That's not your mother. It's a man, baby! Yeah, yeah. Come on! Why won't this wig come off?

Now er... you tell us a little about yourself. The details of my life are quite inconsequential. Oh, no. Please, please. Let... Let's hear about your childhood. Yeah. Come on. Come on. Very well. Where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium... with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a 15-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy... the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical... summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring, we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard, really. At the age of 12, I received my first scribe. At the age of 14, a Zoroastrian named Vilma... ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum. It's breathtaking. I suggest you try it. You know, we have to stop. Austin, can I have a word with you? Of course you may, luv. Look, I know I'm being neurotic, but... I can't shake off this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary. You know, Miss Fagina. And I don't want to sound paranoid but... I've had some bad relationships in the past and... I have been known to be jealous. I'm sorry. No, don't be sorry, baby. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. What? I shagged her rotten, baby! Yeah! I don't believe you, Austin. She was repellent. Saucer of milk, table two. But did you use protection? 'Course. I had my nine-millimeter automatic. You know I meant did you use a condom? No. Only sailors use condoms, baby. Not in the nineties, Austin. Well, they should, those filthy beggars.

And they're all: \"Get out\". And we're like: \"Make me\". It was cool. Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening? I thought I'd stay in. There's a good titty movie on Skinimax. And that's how you'd like to live your life, is it? Yeah. - Pretty much worth. - What? Yeah. Okay. Scott... I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis Austin Powers. Are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?"

I've spent 30 years of my life... turning this two-bit evil empire into a world-class multinational. I was going to have a cover story in Forbes. But, you, like an idiot, wanted to take over the world... and you don't realize there is no world anymore. It's only corporations. - Silence, Number Two! - No! I've had enough of you pushing me around. Mr. Powers... I have a business proposition you might find very interesting. Right. I've had enough. Judo chop! The complex will self-destruct. Come on! Let's split! Let's go! This place is going to blow! We must go! I bought you your orange shirbirt. Thank you! The complex will self-destruct. Come on, let's go! The complex will self-destruct. This way, Austin. Come on, baby! It's gonna blow! Let's go. Move it! Allez-hop! I love you, Mr. Powers. And I love you, Mrs. Powers. Oh, that'll be Basil Exposition. Oh, ignore it, Austin. Come back to bed. Duty calls, baby. Hello, Austin. Oh, I er... I hope I'm not interrupting your honeymoon. No, not at all, Basil. Did you get that fruit basket I sent you? Yes, we did, Basil, but you sent too much. I'm gonna have to send some to my mother. Oh, don't forget these. - Oh, thanks. - There you go. Did you get my other gift? We did. Yes, Basil, nice rack. But who in the world gave us this drawing? It's bizarre. Well, as you know, Dr. Evil has escaped in his rocket... which has disappeared from our tracking system. Oh dear. Hold on. Coffee? - Oh, yes, please. - Okay. Thank you. Oh, and, Vanessa, by the way, you have been made a full agent. Oh, that's fantastic, Basil! Thanks. Milk? Yes, please. And, Austin, Her Majesty the Queen informs me... that you are to be knighted. Very shagadelic! Well, the best of luck to both of you! I can't believe that you are married, Austin. Oh, what a lovely pair. Thanks, Basil. I think I'm gonna like living in the nineties. - Bye-bye. - Good-bye. You know, Vanessa... I'll never forget the first time I saw you. You were so incredibly beautiful... so incredibly sexy... I knew I had to have you... right then and there. Did you feel the same way? Actually, I couldn't stop staring at your teeth. Oh, I ordered some champagne.",
