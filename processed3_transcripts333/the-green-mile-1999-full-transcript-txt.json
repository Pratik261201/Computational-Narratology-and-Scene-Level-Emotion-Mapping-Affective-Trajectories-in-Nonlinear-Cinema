(INDISTINCT TALKING ON RADIO) (TURNS OFF RADIO) (WATER RUNNING) Good morning, Estelle. - OLD MAN: How am I looking, Paul? - That's better. That's better. (CHATTERING) HECTOR: Morning, Mr. Edgecomb. Some Danish this morning? No, just two pieces of dry toast, Hector. Thanks. Leftover's fine. - Dry and cold, same as always. - Cold is better. Hmm. Especially on those long walks. Am I right? Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you. She'll raise holy hell. We're not supposed to let you wander off. Where do you go every day? What do you do up in those hills? Just walk. I like to walk. You try not to fall down, bust a hip. I don't wanna be in no damn search party. (THUNDER RUMBLES) WOMAN 1: You want this Man constantly in your life? Explain the moral basis of that. WOMAN 2: I've made mistakes. Tony doesn't admit that he's not a good father. She can't ask nothing. You can't ask nothing. I have six kids myself. Why do we always watch this stuff? It's interesting. Interesting? Bunch of inbred trailer trash? All they ever talk about is fucking. - WOMAN 1: Ain't no way - in this green earth... I'd have a father like that. If what you saying is true... No, I'm talking now. I'm talking now. What kind of a mother are you? WOMAN 3: One that causes people more... MAN 1: Is going to let you try the bodystrider... You're dead! You can't come back! MAN 2: It's back. The Popeil Pocket Fisherman. WOMAN 4: Take my husband, take my kids... - Are you all right? - Hmm? You look tired. You're not yourself. No, I'm fine. I promise. You're wearing yourself out with those walks every day, I think. Not that you asked me. I just didn't sleep well, is all. I had a few bad dreams. It happens. I'll be fine. (SINGING AND WHOOPING) If Madge doesn't care, I certainly don't. Neither do I. Now, this here is worth a look. JERRY: I'm in heaven. And my heart beats so That I can hardly speak. And I seem to find. The happiness I seek. When we're out together Dancing cheek to cheek. Heaven I'm in heaven. And the cares that hung around me. Through the week. Seem to vanish. Like a gambler's lucky streak (PAUL SNIFFLES) Paul, what is it? (SOBBING) My God. I've got to get out of here.",

They bust the Springs? Ho... Dead Man! Dead Man walking! - Who...? - We got a dead Man walking here! Jesus, please us, what is he yelling about?

I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg next day or so for some tests. Head X-rays and who knows what else. She is scared to death. Truth to tell, so am I. If it's something they can see on the X-ray... maybe it's something they can fix. Maybe. This just came in. Doe on Bitterbuck. You didn't come all the way down here to hand me a Doe. I had an angry call from the state capitol about 20 minutes ago. Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore off the block? It is. Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul... but like it or not, the wife of the governor has only one nephew... and his name is Percy Wetmore. Little Percy calls his aunt... and squeals like a schoolroom sissy. He also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of sheer petulance? Broke three fingers on Eduard Delacroix's left hand. I didn't hear that part. I'm sure she didn't either. The Man is mean and careless and stupid... and that's a bad combination in a place like this. Sooner or later, he'll get somebody hurt or worse. Stick with it, Paul. It may not be much longer. I have it on good authority that Percy has an application in at Briar Ridge. Briar Ridge? The mental hospital. Administration job. Better pay. Hmm. Then why is he still here? He could get that application pushed through. Hell, with his connections, he could have any state job he wants. You know what I think? I think he just wants to see one cook up close. Well, he'll get his chance, then. Won't he? Maybe then he'll be satisfied and move on. In the meantime... - you'll keep the peace? - Of course. Of course. Thank you, Paul. Hal... you give Melinda my love, okay? I'm sure that X-ray will turn out to be nothing at all. You bet. (BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS) JAN: Paul. - Hey, you. - Hey. The music too loud? There's just this empty spot in the bed where my husband usually sleeps. He said to tell you he's having a little trouble with that tonight. Worried about Melinda and Hal? Is that what's got you up? Yeah, that... and things. Things. We got a new inmate today. Simple-minded fella. Do I wanna know what he did? - No. - Mmm. Things that happen in this world. It's a wonder God allows it.",

I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg next day or so for some tests. Head X-rays and who knows what else. She is scared to death. Truth to tell, so am I. If it's something they can see on the X-ray... maybe it's something they can fix. Maybe. This just came in. Doe on Bitterbuck. You didn't come all the way down here to hand me a Doe. I had an angry call from the state capitol about 20 minutes ago. Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore off the block? It is. Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul... but like it or not, the wife of the governor has only one nephew... and his name is Percy Wetmore. Little Percy calls his aunt... and squeals like a schoolroom sissy. He also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of sheer petulance? Broke three fingers on Eduard Delacroix's left hand. I didn't hear that part. I'm sure she didn't either. The Man is mean and careless and stupid... and that's a bad combination in a place like this. Sooner or later, he'll get somebody hurt or worse. Stick with it, Paul. It may not be much longer. I have it on good authority that Percy has an application in at Briar Ridge. Briar Ridge? The mental hospital. Administration job. Better pay. Hmm. Then why is he still here? He could get that application pushed through. Hell, with his connections, he could have any state job he wants. You know what I think? I think he just wants to see one cook up close. Well, he'll get his chance, then. Won't he? Maybe then he'll be satisfied and move on. In the meantime... - you'll keep the peace? - Of course. Of course. Thank you, Paul. Hal... you give Melinda my love, okay? I'm sure that X-ray will turn out to be nothing at all. You bet.  JAN: Paul. - Hey, you. - Hey. The music too loud? There's just this empty spot in the bed where my husband usually sleeps. He said to tell you he's having a little trouble with that tonight. Worried about Melinda and Hal? Is that what's got you up? Yeah, that... and things. Things. We got a new inmate today. Simple-minded fella. Do I wanna know what he did? - No. - Mmm. Things that happen in this world. It's a wonder God allows it."

No, but a Man who does a thing like that... has often developed a taste for it over time. It occurred to me... that it might be easy enough to follow his back trail. Find out. A Man his size, and colored to boot, can't be that hard to trace. You'd think so, but you'd be wrong. Believe me, we tried. Like he'd dropped out of the sky. How can that be? We're in a depression.

And I think a part of... whatever magic was inside of him... just leapt into my tiny friend here. As for me... John had to give me a part of himself... a gift, the way he saw it... so that I could see for myself what Wild Bill had done. When John did that... when he took my hand... a part of the power that worked through him... spilled into me. He what? He infected you with life? It's as good a word as any. He infected us both, didn't he, Mr. Jingles? With life. I'm 108 years old, Elaine. I was 44 the year that John Coffey walked the Green Mile. You mustn't blame John. He couldn't help what happened. He was just a force of nature. Oh, I've lived to see some amazing things, Ellie. Another century come to pass. But I've... I've had to see my friends and loved ones die off through the years. Hal and Melinda... Brutus Howell... my wife, my boy. And you, Elaine. You'll die too. And my curse is knowing that I'll be there to see it. It's my atonement, you see. It's my punishment... for letting John Coffey ride the lightning. For killing a miracle of God. PRIEST: Almighty, everlasting God... the source of all being and life... PAUL: You'll be gone like all the others. I'll have to stay. Oh, I'll die eventually. Of that I'm sure. I have no illusions of immortality. But I will have wished for death... long before death finds me. In truth, I wish for it already. (WOMAN SINGING ON RADIO) Mr. Jingles? Where you been? Been worried about you, boy. You hungry? Let's go see if we can't find you something to eat. A few crumbs anyway. I know you'd like that. Look at you. I lie in bed most nights thinking about it. And I wait. I think about all the people I've loved... now long gone. I think about my beautiful Jan... how I lost her so many years ago. And I think about all of us walking our own Green Mile... each in our own time. But one thought more than any other... keeps me awake most nights: If he could make a mouse live so long... how much longer do I have? We each owe a death. There are no exceptions. But, oh, God... sometimes... the Green Mile seems so long.",

        "But we make do. Don't we, old fella? I think Mr. Jingles happened by accident. I think when we electrocuted Del, and it all went so badly... well, John could feel that, you know. And I think a part of... whatever magic was inside of him... just leapt into my tiny friend here. As for me... John had to give me a part of himself... a gift, the way he saw it... so that I could see for myself what Wild Bill had done. When John did that... when he took my hand... a part of the power that worked through him... spilled into me. He what? He infected you with life? It's as good a word as any. He infected us both, didn't he, Mr. Jingles? With life. I'm 108 years old, Elaine. I was 44 the year that John Coffey walked the Green Mile. You mustn't blame John. He couldn't help what happened. He was just a force of nature. Oh, I've lived to see some amazing things, Ellie. Another century come to pass. But I've... I've had to see my friends and loved ones die off through the years. Hal and Melinda... Brutus Howell... my wife, my boy. And you, Elaine. You'll die too. And my curse is knowing that I'll be there to see it. It's my atonement, you see. It's my punishment... for letting John Coffey ride the lightning. For killing a miracle of God. PRIEST: Almighty, everlasting God... the source of all being and life... PAUL: You'll be gone like all the others. I'll have to stay. Oh, I'll die eventually. Of that I'm sure. I have no illusions of immortality. But I will have wished for death... long before death finds me. In truth, I wish for it already.  Mr. Jingles? Where you been? Been worried about you, boy. You hungry? Let's go see if we can't find you something to eat. A few crumbs anyway. I know you'd like that. Look at you. I lie in bed most nights thinking about it. And I wait. I think about all the people I've loved... now long gone. I think about my beautiful Jan... how I lost her so many years ago.
