      "raw_text": "Man is omnipotent. Nothing is impossible for him. What seemed to be unthinkable undertakings yesterday are history today. The conquest of the moon for example, who talks about it anymore? Today we are already on the threshold of conquering our galaxy. And in the not too distant tomorrow We'll be considering the conquest of the universe. And yet man seems to ignore the fact that on this very planet there are still people living in the stone age and practicing cannibalism. Primitive tribes isolated in ruthless hostile environments where the prevailing law is survival of the fittest. And this jungle which its inhabitants refer to as the Green Inferno is only a few hours flying time from New York City. Was it to remind us of this that four brave young Americans went there to make a documentary on life in the jungle? Was it also to remind us, for instance, that before venturing into space we should become more acquainted with the planet that we live on? Four young and fearless Americans, children of the space age: armed with cameras, microphones, and curiosity: Alan Yates. A director famous for his documentaries on Vietnam and Africa. Faye Daniels. His girlfriend and script girl. And their two cameramen and inseparable friends, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Four youngsters who never came back. But let's have a look at them at the beginning of their incredible adventure, here at the border between Brazil and Peru. They are about to board a plane to take them to the Rio Ocoro, a last outpost from which they will continue on foot… deep into the Amazon Jungle… into the area known as the Green Inferno. Hey, are you really not scared? Not at all. I 've been in plenty of other dangerous places with them. What about you, Alan? Well there's only one thing scares me-- and that's marriage. He'd take me to the North Pole to put it off. I'd say he's succeeded this time too. And this is the last time. Yeah, provided we come back in one piece. Alright, alright… Let's go. Well, you four certainly aren't the first to embark on such an adventure. There was an expedition in '59, and another in '67, and neither of them came back. Ah, yeah, that was Smith and that bunch of Frenchmen. - Yes. Yeah, Frenchmen, they were amateurs, a bunch of jerks.",

Professor Harold Monroe, NYU's noted anthropologist has taken part in various expeditions exploring primitive cultures. But this will be his first journey into Amazonia. Ugha… Help him! Enough. Look at what he's carrying… a lighter! Poor Oliveira, He was only 20 years old. Once it hits the bloodstream, there is nothing one can do. Better a bullet than a dart from a blowgun. But we gave him the serum at the right time. Sure, the serum It only works half the time… if it isn't already too old by the time we get it. The guys won't give a shit after the death of Oliveira.

I'll be as little trouble as possible, it's just… I'm sure you got enough problems of your own. I'll have to be honest with you… No, no thanks… I need your help in organizing this expedition. How can I refuse? You have been recommended by everybody in our community as well as yours. If only I sure can guarantee that you'll still be breathing when you return. Look, I know this is not going to be a picnic, believe me. This is not my first trip into bush. A skunk must have pissed that. Lieutenant… this lighter belonged to Faye Daniels.

The lieutenant here was telling me what a… what an excellent guide you are. You gonna take all of this with you in the jungle? Yes, well forget it. We're gonna need some weapons… some ammunition plus some medicine, that's all we need. I already told your friends. In there, the more you carry, the quicker you get tired, the sooner you die. Alright, alright… All I wanna know Mr. Chaco is do we have a chance… of finding them alive? Who's to say? The only thing I know is we're gonna risk our lives to save those fuckers. Let's go see the Yacumo. Great warriors, these Yacumos! They're afraid of no one except for the Tree People. Tree People? No white man has ever seen them. - Or the ones who have, never lived to tell about it. Did you see this? Looks like the sacred scar of Ateri. That's what it is. He's a son of a shaman and he's been consecrated to the spirit of the jaguar, Which also explains what they were doing this far from home. What do you mean? Ah, they were caught, yet they are not really cannibals. Which means it was probably some religious ceremony meant to chase evil spirits outta the jungle… white men's spirits. Come on, Professor, Quit worrying about Yacumo! You can't afford to waste your strength helping that savage. He'll outlive all of us! Can you make it? We'll have to wade across. But there's no piranhas here. Come on! Come on…come on! There may not be any piranhas, but there's always a few hungry cavemen around. Leeches! Leave that shit alone. He can't do it by himself and there's three of us here, Why can't we help him? - Don't try this again Professor. Here, we do as I say, and this bastard has to know who is the strongest. Chaco's right, señor. This guy's completely full of hate. As soon as you don't look, he will slit your throat. They passed this way. Yacumos dig a hole to cook. And it means… We're following the same trail, right? Right. Hey, Professor! I recognize these teeth. This is Felipe Ocaña. He knew the jungle as well as I do. That makes me feel terrific. I wonder what was his mistake. See that? We're near his village; he can already smell his home. Hey! Hey! Mira! Here comes dinner… Hey.",

Yeah, to return the prisoner and to talk. Listen, I do not know about this. I think they want us for dinner tonight. Chaco… Pretend you've seen nothing. Okay. Friends shot him. Let's hope he doesn't die from the wound. Get busy, Miguel! You can breathe easy… It's alright now, Professor. Kimnamma."

By some incredible act of God they hadn't tried to open it. I'm hoping the climate hadn't damaged it too much. And so in exchange for the tape recorder, the Cannibal chief let you take away the cans of film. Is that it? Yes, they thought since I was capable of capturing the human voice, I was also capable of capturing their spirits. This convinced them that I was the only one capable of breaking the evil spell that had been cast over the tribe by their murder of the whites. Of course, they had no inkling of what was really in those cans. How could you explain what a movie is? They just felt they were a threat. Why do you say threat? Well the Yanomamo's understood how important these film cans were to Alan Yates's crew. They thought the silver boxes contained his power. The power, which I must say again, caused much damage and violence. A fantastic story. Thank you, Professor Monroe. You're very welcome. As we conclude this special interview we would like to remind you Wednesday, at 9 pm, here on Pantheon, we'll be presenting part one of The Green Inferno. The dramatic film testimony, of an extraordinary adventure that took its protagonists all the way back to the stone age. And you would be the ideal host of the program? That's right. Professor Monroe, as an eye witness as well as a scientist, you would be the most-- Yes… but before I make any decisions I'd like to review all the film material. As of yet we've seen none of it. Professor Monroe, I can assure you that they knew exactly what they wanted. That may be. But meanwhile, they're all dead, aren't they? Which is exactly why we have to let the public know the truth. We'll let the people be the judge. Better yet, we'll let the people who knew them best be the judge. Their parents, their wives. This is a documentary they shot for us about a year and a half ago.

Well, I never thought of it that way, but it's an interesting idea. - Yes. Let's say things are reversed, right, and the Yacumo attacked your house defiled everything you held holy.

Had a long discussion last nigh about whether to keep going or turn back. Wasn't easy to come to an agreement. Perhaps the others are right, maybe we shouldn't push our luck. God knows we've been lucky so far. But you know what finally convinced them? The chance to become famous. To reach that spot where… time stopped three or four thousand years ago. Where the Yanomamos, the Tree People, live in constant strife with their, their enemies the Shamatares. See this guy?",

Bound together by the basic needs of survival. To protect itself, the tribe must eliminate any diseased elements. Now don't go away. What your about to see may simply be described as social surgery. Had a long discussion last nigh about whether to keep going or turn back. Wasn't easy to come to an agreement. Perhaps the others are right, maybe we shouldn't push our luck. God knows we've been lucky so far. But you know what finally convinced them? The chance to become famous. To reach that spot where… time stopped three or four thousand years ago. Where the Yanomamos, the Tree People, live in constant strife with their, their enemies the Shamatares. See this guy?"
