(whistle) - Time gun ready? - Ready and charged, sir. - Three minutes and six seconds. - Aye aye, sir. What he's famous for is punctuality. The whole world takes its time from Greenwich. But Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom. What cheer, Admiral? Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound? Number 17. Got some parties here in tow what wants to see it. - Enter that in the log. - (man) Aye aye, sir. A word of advice, young man: Storm signals are up at Number 17. Bit of heavy weather brewing there. Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned. Here we are. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Residence of George Banks, Esquire. - Hello, hello, hello.

I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door. But who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house? Me, that's who! Her and her high and mighty ways! And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would. Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn't stay in this house another minute, not if you heaped me with all the jewels in Christendom. - No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go! - Stand away from that door, my girl! But what am I going to tell the master about the children? It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time. They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park? You know how Jane and Michael is. Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya? You know how fond they was of hangin' around the cage. I've said my say, and that's all I'll say. I've done with this house forever. Well, hip, hip, hooray! And don't stumble on the way out, dearie. - Now, now, Katie Nanna! - (woman singing) Mrs Banks! She's home! # Our daughters' daughters will adore us and we'll sing in grateful chorus # Well done, Sister Suffragette Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen. We had the most glorious meeting! Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the wheel of the prime minister's carriage. - You should've been there. - Mrs Banks, I would like a word with you. And Mrs Ainslie, she was carried off to prison, singing and scattering pamphlets all the way! I'm glad you're home, madam. I've always given the best that's in me... Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna. I always knew you were one of us. # We're clearly soldiers in petticoats # And dauntless crusaders for women's votes # Though we adore men individually # We agree that as a group they're rather stupid - Mrs Banks... - # Cast off the shackles of yesterday # Shoulder to shoulder into the fray # Our daughters' daughters will adore us # And they'll sing in grateful chorus # Well done, Sister Suffragette Be that as it may, I do not wish to offend, but I... # From Kensington to Billingsgate one hears the restless cries # From every corner of the land womankind arise # Political equality - # And equal rights with men - (shrieks) # Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again # No more the meek and mild subservients we # We're fighting for our rights militantly # Never you fear If I may have a word, Mrs Banks.",

What? Well, of course they're here! Where else would they be? - I don't know, George. - You don't know? Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere. Very well. I'll deal with this at once. Give me the police station. Quickly, please. I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter... Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts. One fact and one fact alone is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's faltered at her post. She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to book... Oh. She's left us, hasn't she? Yes, dear. Only just. - What? Uh, yes. George Banks here. Yes. - (door bell) 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency. I should like you to send a policeman around immediately. The policeman's here, George! What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service. Thank you so much. Good night. Come in, Constable. Come in. Thank you, sir. While going about my duties on the other side of the park, I noted some valuables that had gone astray. I believe they're yours, sir. Valuables? Come along, now. Come along. - (Mrs Banks) Jane! Michael! - Winifred, please don't be emotional. Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today. Children, come here at once. - Well? - I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father. - You see, it was windy... - And the kite was too strong for us. In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children. Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this. Actually, it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves. - Perhaps if you helped us to make one... - Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things. Why, only last week with me own youngsters... I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children. And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen, Cook will find you a plate of something.",

        "# It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910 # King Edward's on the throne It's the Age of Men # I'm the lord of my castle The sovereign, the liege # I treat my subjects, servants, children, wife # With a firm but gentle hand Noblesse oblige # It's 6.03, and the heirs to my dominion # Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed # And so I'll pat them on the head and send them off to bed # Ah, lordly is the life I lead - Winifred, where are the children? - They're not here, dear. What? Well, of course they're here! Where else would they be? - I don't know, George. - You don't know? Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere. Very well. I'll deal with this at once. Give me the police station. Quickly, please. I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter... Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts. One fact and one fact alone is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's faltered at her post. She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to book... Oh. She's left us, hasn't she? Yes, dear. Only just. - What? Uh, yes. George Banks here. Yes. -  17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency. I should like you to send a policeman around immediately. The policeman's here, George! What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service. Thank you so much. Good night. Come in, Constable. Come in. Thank you, sir. While going about my duties on the other side of the park, I noted some valuables that had gone astray. I believe they're yours, sir. Valuables? Come along, now. Come along. -  Jane! Michael! - Winifred, please don't be emotional. Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today. Children, come here at once. - Well? - I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father. - You see, it was windy... - And the kite was too strong for us. In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children. Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this. Actually, it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves. - Perhaps if you helped us to make one... - Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things. Why, only last week with me own youngsters... I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children. And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen, Cook will find you a plate of something."

After our meeting at the Albert Hall, we're all going to Downing Street to throw things at the prime minister. Oh, how distinguished you look this morning, George. What's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen? - It's Cook singing. - Cook singing? What's wrong with her? She's as happy as a cricket. As a matter of fact, since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing seems to have come over the household. - Is that so? - Take Ellen, for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning. - Really? Well, that is extraordinary. - And another thing. She and Cook usually fight like cats and dogs, but today... - Let me hold the door for you, Ellen dear. - Thanks ever so, ducks.

It's something to say when you don't know what to say. Yes, well, I always know what to say. Go on, hurry along, please. Yes, Father. # Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious... Winifred, will you be good enough to explain this unseemly hullabaloo? I don't think there's anything to explain, do you? It's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning.

        "In a watch factory? What does he do? He stands about all day and makes faces! He makes faces in a watch fa... You made that up. That's so good! Such behaviour! Well, it's the most disgraceful sight I've ever seen, or my name isn't Mary Poppins. Speaking of names, I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith. What's the name of his other leg? Wasn't that funny? What's the name of his other... Now then, children, it's time for tea. I will not have my schedule interrupted. Oh, please stay. Look, I have a splendid tea all ready for you. And it's getting cold. Well, I had hoped that maybe, that you would just, that... Splendid! Thank you very much! Keep your feet back. Mind the bread and butter. Now, watch it, children. I knew she could bring it off. And a proper tea it is too. Next thing, I suppose, you'll be wanting me to pour out. Oh, well. If I must, I must. If you'll just stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas! - Two lumps, Uncle Albert? - Yes, please. - Bert? - No, thank you, no sugar for me. I'm so glad you came. It wouldn't be any fun without you. Here, and you may pour some milk for Michael and yourself. Nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think? Oh, yeah. Speaking of weather...

Children, will you please sit up properly at the table? - Your tea, Uncle Albert. - Oh, thank you, my dear. I'm having such a good time. I wish that you could all stay up here all the time.

Let me see... I've got the very thing. Yesterday, when the lady next door answered the bell, there was a man there. And the man said to the lady, \"I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat.\" - Oh, that's sad. - The poor cat. And then the man said, \"I'd like to replace your cat.\" And the lady said, \"That's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?\" Well, you know, I started out sad. I try, really I do. But, but everything ends up so hilarious, I can't..."

To carve his niche in the edifice of time. # Before the mortar of his zeal # Has a chance to congeal The cup is dashed from his lips! The flame is snuffed a-borning. He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime. Life is a rum go, guv'nor, and that's the truth. You know what I think? It's that woman Mary Poppins. From the moment she stepped into this house, things began to happen to me! - Mary Poppins? - Yes, yes, of course. # My world was calm # Well-ordered # Exemplary # Then came this person # With chaos in her wake # And now my life's ambitions go # With one fell blow # It's quite a bitter pill # To take It's that Poppins woman! She did it! I know the very person you mean. Mary Poppins. She's the one what sings... # A spoonful of sugar # That is all it takes # It changes bread and water # Into tea and cakes You see? That's exactly what I mean! Changing bread and water into tea and cakes, indeed! No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy here. # A spoonful of sugar # Goes a long, long way # Have yourself a healthy helpin' # Every day An 'ealthy helpin' of trouble, if you ask me. Do you know what she did? I realise it now. She tricked me into taking Jane and Michael to the bank. That's how all the trouble started. Tricked you into taking the children on an outing? - Yes. - Outrageous! A man with all the important things you have to do. Shameful! You're a man of high position. Esteemed by your peers. # And when your little tykes are cryin' # You haven't time to dry their tears # And see them grateful little faces # Smilin' up at you # Because their dad # He always knows just what to do - Well, I mean, look, I don't think I... - Like you say, guv'nor."
