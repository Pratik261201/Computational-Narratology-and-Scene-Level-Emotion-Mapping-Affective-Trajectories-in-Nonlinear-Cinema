Okay, all clear. Ha. All this equipment is brand new. Carrots. Claw marks. Yeah, huge, huge claw marks. What kind of... Mr. Manchas. It's him! We found our otter. Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps. Your wife sent me to find you. We're gonna get you out of here now. Or not. Guess he's in no rush to get home to the missus. 11, 12, 13, 14. Not including Manchas, it's... it's fourteen. Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files. They're all here... All the missing mammals are right here. Huh! Enough! I don't want excuses, doctor, I want answers. Mayor Lionheart, please. We're doing everything we can. Really? Cause I got a dozen and a half animals here who've gone off the rails crazy, And you can't tell me why. Now I'd call that awfully far from doing everything! Sir, it may be time to consider their biology. What? What do you mean \"biology\"? The only animals going savage are predators. We cannot keep it a secret. We need to come forward. Hm, great idea. Tell the public. And how do you think they're gonna feel about their mayor who is a lion?! - I'll be ruined! - Well, what does Chief Bogo say? Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we are going to keep it that way. Oh, no! - Someone's here. - Sir, you need to go. Now. Security, sweep the area. Great, we're dead. We're dead. That's it. I'm dead. You're dead. Everybody's dead. - Can you swim? - What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why? Aaahhhh! Carrots! Hopps! Judy! We gotta tell Bogo! Wow, you are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo. - Chief Bogo! - Not now. - Wait, is that Gazelle? - No! I'm Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer. You have the app too? Ooohhh... Chief! Clawhauser! Can't you see I'm working on the missing mammal cases? Oh! Yes, of course. About that, sir. Officer Hopps just called, she found all of them. Wow, I'm impressed. Mayor Lionheart, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you... You don't understand, I was trying to protect the city! You were just trying to protect your job. No, listen. We still don't know why this is happening. It could destroy Zootopia. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.",

What can you tell us about the case?\" \"Well, was this a tough case? Yes, yes it was. You see?\" You should be up there with me. We did this together. Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

Are they all different species? Yes. Yes, they are. Okay, so what is the connection? Oh. All we know is that they are all members of the predator family. So predators are the only ones going savage? That is accu.. Yes, that is accurate, yes. - Why? Why is this happening? - We still don't know. But, emm. It may have something to do with biology. What do you mean, biology? A biological component. You know, something in their DNA. In their DNA, can you elaborate on that, please? Yes. What I mean is thousands of years ago Eh, predators survived through their... agressive hunting instincts. For whatever reason, they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. Officer Hopps, could it happen again? It is possible. So, we must be vigilant. And we at the ZPD are prepered and are here to protect you. - Will more mammals go savage? - What is being done to protect us? Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators?

That went so fast, I didn't get a chance to mention you or say anything about how we... Oh, I think you said plenty.

The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around fox repellant? Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met. Look. Let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me? Do you think I might go nuts? You think I might go savage? You think I might try to eat you? Huh! I knew it, huh. Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me, huh? Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner. No, Nick. Nick! Officer Hopps, were you just threatened by that predator? No, he's my friend. We can't even trust our own friends? That is not what I said. Please. - Are we safe? - Have any other foxes gone savage? More bad news in this city gripped by fear. A caribou is in critical condition. The victim of a mauling by a savage polar bear. This, the 27th such attack, comes just one week after ZPD Officer, Judy Hopps connected the violence to traditionally predatory animals. Meanwhile, a peace rally organized by popstar Gazelle was marred by protest. - Go back to the forest, predator! - I am from the savannah. Zootopia is a unique place. It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city. Where we celebrate our differences. This is not the Zootopia I know. The Zootopia I know is better than this. We don't just blindly assign blame. We don't know why these attacks keep happening. But it's irresponsible to label all predators as savages. It's not my Emmitt. We cannot let fear divide us. Please give me back the Zootopia I love. Come on, Hopps. The new mayor wants to see us. The mayor? Why? It would seem you've arrived. Clawhauser? What are you doing? Uh. They thought it would be better if a predator such as myself wasn't the first face that you see when you walk into the ZPD. What? They're gonna move me to records. It's downstairs. It's by the boiler. Hopps1 Integrity Honesty Bravery Emm. I don't understand. Our city is 90% prey, Judy, and right now they're just really scared. You're a hero to them. They trust you. And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD. I'm... not... I'm not a hero. I came here to make the world a better place.",

It's what you've wanted since you were a kid. You can't quit. Thank you for the opportunity. A dozen carrots. Have a nice day. Come on. Hey there, Jude. Jude the Dude. Remember that one? How we doing? - I'm fine. - You are not fine, your ears are droopy. Why did I think I could make a difference? - Because you're a trier, that's why. - You've always been a trier. Oh, I tried. And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators. Oh, not all of them, though. Speak of the devil. Right on time. Is that Gideon Grey? Yeah, it sure is. We work with him now. He's our partner. And we never would have considered it, - had you not opened our minds. - That's right. I mean, kid's turned into one of the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows. That's... That's really cool, you guys. Gideon Grey. I'll be darned. Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry for the way I behaved in my youth. I had a lot of self-doubt, and it manifested itself in the form of unchecked rage and agression. I was a major jerk. Well, I know a thing or two about being a jerk. Anyhow, I brought you all these pies. Hey, kids! Don't you run through that midnicampum holicithias. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, now. There's a four-dollar word, Mr. H. My family always just call them Night Howlers. I'm sorry. What did you say? Oh. Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy. I use them to keep the bugs off the produce, but I don't like the little ones going near them on acoount of what happened to your uncle Terry. Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids and went completely nuts. He bit the dickens out of your mother. A bunny can go savage. Savage? Well, that's a strong word. But it did hurt like the devil. Well, sure it did. There's a sizable divot in your arm. I'd call that savage. Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're flowers. The flowers are making the predators go savage. That's it! That's what I've been missing! Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry, come on! Oh.",

With all due respect, sir, a good cop is supposed to serve and protect. Help the city. Not tear it apart. - I don't deserve this badge. - Hopps. Judy, you've worked so hard to get here. It's what you've wanted since you were a kid. You can't quit. Thank you for the opportunity. A dozen carrots. Have a nice day. Come on. Hey there, Jude. Jude the Dude. Remember that one? How we doing? - I'm fine. - You are not fine, your ears are droopy. Why did I think I could make a difference? - Because you're a trier, that's why. - You've always been a trier. Oh, I tried. And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators. Oh, not all of them, though. Speak of the devil. Right on time. Is that Gideon Grey? Yeah, it sure is. We work with him now. He's our partner. And we never would have considered it, - had you not opened our minds. - That's right. I mean, kid's turned into one of the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows. That's... That's really cool, you guys. Gideon Grey. I'll be darned. Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry for the way I behaved in my youth. I had a lot of self-doubt, and it manifested itself in the form of unchecked rage and agression. I was a major jerk. Well, I know a thing or two about being a jerk. Anyhow, I brought you all these pies. Hey, kids! Don't you run through that midnicampum holicithias. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, now. There's a four-dollar word, Mr. H. My family always just call them Night Howlers. I'm sorry. What did you say? Oh. Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy. I use them to keep the bugs off the produce, but I don't like the little ones going near them on acoount of what happened to your uncle Terry. Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids and went completely nuts. He bit the dickens out of your mother. A bunny can go savage. Savage? Well, that's a strong word. But it did hurt like the devil. Well, sure it did. There's a sizable divot in your arm. I'd call that savage. Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're flowers. The flowers are making the predators go savage. That's it! That's what I've been missing! Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry, come on! Oh."
