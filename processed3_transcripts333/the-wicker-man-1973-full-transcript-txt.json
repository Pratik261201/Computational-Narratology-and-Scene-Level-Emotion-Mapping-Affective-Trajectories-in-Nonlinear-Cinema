No, sir, I don't think so. - This is Summerisle, is it not? - It is, sir! Well, I'm right then. Now, would you send a dinghy, please? I'm afraid it can't be done, sir! This is private property! You can't land here without written permission! I, as you can see, am a police officer. A complaint has been registered by a resident of this island about a missing child. Now, that makes it a police matter, private property or not. Now, will you send a dinghy, please? Corn rigs and barley rigs And corn rigs are bonnie I'll not forget that happy night Among the rigs with Annie Good day to you, sir. I'm the harbour master. Sergeant Howie, West Highland police. A missing child is always trouble. Aye, aye, aye, for everybody. Perhaps you would be good enough to explain matters to his lordship. He's most particular who lands here. All in good time. We, too, have our own particularities. You know her? Her name is Rowan Morrison. No, no, never seen her before. I don't know the face either. Do you know her, Kenny? She doesn't belong to this island. No, I never saw her before. No, she doesn't belong here at all. Johnnie? No, can't say I know her. Now, now, what are you saying? You're saying that she is not from the island. Aye, that's right. She's not from here. Oh, you get Morrisons on Lewis and a few on Mull. I would try there. Thanks. \"None of us have seen May Morrison's daughter Rowan since last year. She's only 12, and she's been missing from her home for many months. \" The mother's name is May Morrison. Oh, May! She quite slipped my memory. Of course we've got May. She keeps the post office in the high street. - May Morrison? You're quite sure? - Quite sure. Well, thank you for your help. That's not May's daughter, though! No, she's not May's. Then who is she? The sky was blue the wind was still The moon was shining clearly I set her down with right good will Among the rigs of barley I kenned her heart with all my own I loved her most sincerely I kissed her o'er and o'er again Among the rigs of barley - Good afternoon! - I like your rabbits. Those are hares, not silly old rabbits. Lovely march hares. Can I help you?",

Did you come over in that aeroplane that I saw flying round? - Aye, that's right. - What, just to see me? Well, no, not exactly. I'm making inquiries about your daughter. - We understand that she's missing. - Missing? My daughter? - Aye. You do have a daughter. - Yes. - And that's her? - Oh, never. I tell you no. I think you'd better come with me. This is our Myrtle. She was nine last thursday. She's not a bit like the girl in your photograph. She must be at least 13 or 14, surely. Myrtle, say hello. This is Sergeant- oh! - Howie. - Oh. - Hello, Myrtle. How do you do? Look, mummy, I'm drawing a hare. - Ah. Excuse me, Sergeant. Hello. - Here you are. You can fill in the ears in gray. Oh, sorry. Thank you, Myrtle. Myrtle, do you - do you know Rowan? Of course I do. - You do? - 'Course I do, silly. - Uh, do you know where she is now? - In the fields. She runs and plays there all day. Does she? Do you think she'll be coming back for tea? Tea? Hares don't have tea, silly. - Hares? - She's a hare. Rowan's a hare. She has a lovely time. - Well, tell me- - Well, now, Sergeant. You will stay and have a cup of tea, won't you? - Oh, well, yes, yes, please. - Good. - That's very kind of you. - Um, not at all. It must be thirsty work, asking all those questions, eh? - Ah, aye. - Hello. - Good evening. Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. Hello again. - Are you the landlord here? - Aye. I'm Alder Macgreagor. And you must be the policeman from the mainland. Aye, that's right. Sergeant Howie, West Highland constabulary. I'm quite obviously not going to get back to the mainland tonight so I wondered if you had a room and a bite of supper I could have. - Could you manage that? - Aye, I think that can be arranged. My daughter Willow will show you to your room. Willow! Father? This is Sergeant Howie, a policeman from the mainland, who will be spending the night with us. - This is my daughter, Willow. - Good evening. Show the Sergeant to his room, would you? Much has been said of the strumpets of yore Of wenches and bawdy house queens by the score But I sing of a baggage that we all adore The landlord's daughter You'll never love another Although she's not the kind of girl To take home to your mother Her ale, it is lively and strong to the taste It is brewed with discretion never with haste You can have all you like if you swear not to waste The landlord's daughter And when her name is mentioned The parts of every gentleman do stand up At attention Oh, nothing can delight so - As does the part that lies between - Her left toe And her right toe - I'd like my supper now, please.",

Now, if any of you can give me any idea as to her whereabouts, I'd be most grateful if you'd let me know. No, I'm afraid nobody's seen her, Sergeant. Thank you. These Harvest Festival photographs? Aye. We have one taken at the end of every summer. - What happened to last year's? - Mm, it got broke. Your supper's ready, Sergeant. Willow, show the Sergeant to the dining room. Thank you. It's disgusting. - Thank you. - What's the matter, aren't you hungry? Aye, it's just that most of the food I've had- the farmhouse soup, the potatoes, broad beans - all come out of a can. Broad beans, in their natural state, aren't usually turquoise, are they? - Hmm. Some things in their natural state have the most vivid colors. I just wanted to know why, that's all. Now, I wonder what you'll be wanting for afters? - Hmm, I'll have an apple. - No apples. No apples? On Summerisle? I expect they've all been exported. You can have peaches and cream, if you like.

Really, Daisy. - You've been told often enough. - Miss Rose, I know! - All right, then, anybody. - Phallic symbol. The phallic symbol. That is correct. It is the image of the penis, which is venerated in religions such as ours, as simbolising the generative force in nature. Oh, can I help you? C- could-could I have a word with you, please, miss? Certainly. Girls, open your desks and take out your exercise books. Miss, you can be quite sure that I shall report this to the proper authorities. Everywhere I go on this island, it seems to me I find degeneracy. and there is brawling in bars, there is indecency in public places, and there is corruption of the young, and now I see it all stems from here- it stems from the filth taught here in this very schoolroom. I was unaware that the police had any authority in matters of education. Aye, aye, well, we'll see about that. Girls, could I have your attention, please? Now, I am a police officer. Well, as you can see. I have come here from the mainland... to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. I have a photograph here- excuse me- which I would like you to pass around amongst yourselves. Meanwhile, I'll write her name over there on the blackboard. Rowan Morrison. That's her name.

Really, Daisy. - You've been told often enough. - Miss Rose, I know! - All right, then, anybody. - Phallic symbol. The phallic symbol. That is correct. It is the image of the penis, which is venerated in religions such as ours, as simbolising the generative force in nature. Oh, can I help you? C- could-could I have a word with you, please, miss? Certainly. Girls, open your desks and take out your exercise books. Miss, you can be quite sure that I shall report this to the proper authorities. Everywhere I go on this island, it seems to me I find degeneracy. and there is brawling in bars, there is indecency in public places, and there is corruption of the young, and now I see it all stems from here- it stems from the filth taught here in this very schoolroom. I was unaware that the police had any authority in matters of education. Aye, aye, well, we'll see about that. Girls, could I have your attention, please? Now, I am a police officer. Well, as you can see. I have come here from the mainland... to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. I have a photograph here- excuse me- which I would like you to pass around amongst yourselves. Meanwhile, I'll write her name over there on the blackboard. Rowan Morrison. That's her name. Now, do any of you recognize either the name or the photograph? - No. - There's your answer, Sergeant. If she existed, we would know. - Whose desk is that? - No one's. Thank you.

That's a rowan. - And who lies there? - Rowan Morrison. - How long has she been dead? - Oh, six or seven months. They're just a wee bit late with the headstone. What on earth's that? It looks like a piece of skin. - Why, so it is. - Well, what is it? The poor wee lassie's navel string, of course. Where else should it be but hung on her own little tree?

I think I'll manage, my lord, but it does seem to shrink a little each year. I know. My friends, enough now. We shall all reassemble outside the town hall at 3:00 sharp... and then process through the village and the countryside, down to the beach below the stones, by the route which has become sacred to our rite. This year at the procession's end, as has already been proclaimed, a holy sacrifice will be offered up jointly to Nuada, our most sacred god of the Sun, and to Avellenau, the beloved goddess of our orchards, in order that we may furnish them with renewed power... to quicken the growth of our crops. - Hail the Queen of the May! - Hail the Queen of the May! Hail the Queen of the May! Why, Sergeant, I thought you'd gone back. Mrs. Morrison, I don't know if you know it or not, But Rowan is not dead. - They've got her hidden somewhere. - They? Now, if you know where she is, I beg you to tell me now before it's too late. - Sergeant, I've already told you - - In the name of God, woman, what kind of mother are you, that can stand by and see your own child slaughtered? Sergeant, if I were you, I would go back to the mainland. Stop interfering in things that are no concern of yours. I am going to search every house in this place during the next few hours. and if anybody, including you, stands in my way, they'll be arrested as accomplices to murder.

        "- Aye, my lord. Mr. Macgreagor, I trust we aren't going to have to let out your costume again this year. I think I'll manage, my lord, but it does seem to shrink a little each year. I know. My friends, enough now. We shall all reassemble outside the town hall at 3:00 sharp... and then process through the village and the countryside, down to the beach below the stones, by the route which has become sacred to our rite. This year at the procession's end, as has already been proclaimed, a holy sacrifice will be offered up jointly to Nuada, our most sacred god of the Sun, and to Avellenau, the beloved goddess of our orchards, in order that we may furnish them with renewed power... to quicken the growth of our crops. - Hail the Queen of the May! - Hail the Queen of the May! Hail the Queen of the May! Why, Sergeant, I thought you'd gone back. Mrs. Morrison, I don't know if you know it or not, But Rowan is not dead. - They've got her hidden somewhere. - They? Now, if you know where she is, I beg you to tell me now before it's too late. - Sergeant, I've already told you - - In the name of God, woman, what kind of mother are you, that can stand by and see your own child slaughtered? Sergeant, if I were you, I would go back to the mainland. Stop interfering in things that are no concern of yours. I am going to search every house in this place during the next few hours. and if anybody, including you, stands in my way, they'll be arrested as accomplices to murder. You'll simply never understand the true nature of sacrifice. Heathens! Bloody heathens! Yes? - Take those masks off. - No. Take them off! - What do you think you're doing? - Searching every house... for a missing child. Baa baa black sheep, Have you any wool Yes, sir, yes, sir, Three bags full I - I'm sorry. - What's that? - The life of the fields. John Barleycorn.
