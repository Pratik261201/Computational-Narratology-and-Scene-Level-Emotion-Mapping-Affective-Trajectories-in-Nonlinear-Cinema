And she won't be coming to Nairobi. I see. Oh, sweetheart, don't bother to see us off. It could be ages. Okay, well... - It's too hot to be standing around. - If you're sure. - Bye. - Bye, Arnold. - Let me take your bag for you. - Thank you. Bye, sweetheart. See you in, uh... in a couple of days. Sandy, he's here. Hi. Come in. Oh, hi, Sandy. You caught me skiving, I'm afraid. - How's Gloria? Well? - Gloria's fine. You haven't heard from Tessa, I suppose? No, she's, uh, up north with, um, Arnold Bluhm. Look, old chap, do you think you could stop doing that a moment? Something wrong? She didn't say anything about returning by road? From Loki? Well, that wouldn't surprise me, knowing Tessa. I mean, I hope not. Dangerous country. What is it, Sandy? We're getting reports... of a white woman, black driver, found early this morning, southern end of Lake Turkana, dead... killed, it seems. You think it might be Tessa? Seems they hired a car and driver in Loki and then headed east. They spent the night at Lodwar. They shared a room, Justin. The dead black isn't Arnold Bluhm. Most terribly sorry. And how sure are you? It's not looking good. It's... good of you to tell me, Sandy. Can't have been easy. Diplomacy, therefore, as we've demonstrated, is the very map and marker of civilization, pointing nations the safest way through country... fraught with peril. And that's it. Uh, Sir Bernard Pellegrin has asked me to convey his, uh, regrets... that he's been unable to deliver his lecture in person. And I thank you on my own behalf for your very kind attention. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Yeah? - Excu... Excuse me. Yeah, sorry. Sir, I've just got one question. I just wondered whose map, um, is Britain using... when it completely ignores the United Nations... and decides to invade Iraq? Or do you... do you think... it's more diplomatic to bend to the will of a superpower... and... and politely take part in Vietnam, the sequel? Well, uh, I... I can't speak for Sir Bernard... Oh, I thought that's why you were here. I mean, diplomats have to go where they're sent. - So do Labradors.",

It's a bit flashy for my taste. - Is it? - Mm-hmm. Oh. I wouldn't know about. I... I've never been there. Well, I have. I was there the other night meeting someone with Arnold. Oh, well, just a thought. Sweetheart. Were you just inviting me away for a dirty weekend at the Hilton? - Mm-hmm. - Were you? I would love to, but maybe after... - Arturo is born. - Oh, Tessa. We're not calling him Arturo, please. - Why not? - No. Not... Not Arturo... - or Giuseppe... - All right. Then what about... - Garth... Daddy's name? - No, no. Come on. No, not Garth or ditto Che or any... - Che? - I just don't want any of these... mad, eccentric, hippieish... - Che? - Alternative... Yes, your revolutionary half. I think we should call him, in that case, Che Muffin Quayle. - Muffin? - Yes, the Quayle genes. Where do you get Muffin from? - No one's heard of muffins. - High tea by the jolly study fire... while the starving mob burns London. - Is that...

It's a bit flashy for my taste. - Is it? - Mm-hmm. Oh. I wouldn't know about. I... I've never been there. Well, I have. I was there the other night meeting someone with Arnold. Oh, well, just a thought. Sweetheart. Were you just inviting me away for a dirty weekend at the Hilton? - Mm-hmm. - Were you? I would love to, but maybe after... - Arturo is born. - Oh, Tessa. We're not calling him Arturo, please. - Why not? - No. Not... Not Arturo... - or Giuseppe... - All right. Then what about... - Garth... Daddy's name? - No, no. Come on. No, not Garth or ditto Che or any... - Che? - I just don't want any of these... mad, eccentric, hippieish... - Che? - Alternative... Yes, your revolutionary half. I think we should call him, in that case, Che Muffin Quayle. - Muffin? - Yes, the Quayle genes. Where do you get Muffin from? - No one's heard of muffins. - High tea by the jolly study fire... while the starving mob burns London. - Is that...

Yeah, but these are three people that we can help. Please. Justin. I'm sorry, Tessa. I have to put you first. I have to get you home. Probably got enough there now, Mustafa. - Yeah? - I think. Just the flowers this time, please. You can spare the weeds. - The pest must eat too, bwana. - Yes, I know. If only they would. They can eat the weeds. Look, you should be wearing gloves with that, you know? - And there's a mask if you want it. - Okay. It's an outrageous thing. It's almost as if it's a... it's a marriage of convenience... - Tessa. - And the only thing it's gonna produce is dead offspring. I'm sorry to interrupt. What the fuck is that? What? - I said, what the fuck is that? - Tessa, it's pesticide. It... It's just unbelievable. Would you just get that thing out of this house? Well, if you feel that strongly about it, yes, Tessa... anything. It would help if you might explain to me what's upsetting her. I mean, this doesn't kill people, does it?"

But that was issued to me a year ago by the diplomatic office... Sir, the F.C.O. will take care of that. It's just here on the right. - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. - Let me take that for you. - Oh, I'd rather keep it with me. Uh, club rule, Justin. I'm sorry. No... No luggage in the, uh... in the dining room. Could you just tuck it into your cubbyhole, please, Jimmy? - Certainly, sir. - Thank you, sir. My dear fellow, what a dreadful time you've had. Welcome home. Thank you, Bernard. Any, uh, plans, or is it too soon? Plans? Well, holiday, visiting friends, the million things you've always wanted to do in the garden.

Justin Quayle, it's time to get up. - Go away. - Time to get up, Justin. - You're very annoying. - Time to get up . Get up... This is really just not fair. It's time to get up. Tessa, just let me sleep. There's gardening to be done. Weeds to be pulled out. Good morning. Come back to bed. Good morning. Oh, sweetheart. Moral dilemma, Ham. And the person that I most want to tell can't be told. I had a creepy love letter today. It's not your fault. From a five-star creep. You've got to move on, huh? I've cold-bloodedly led on. I stole something from him. And worse, I made him a vile promise that I have... absolutely no intention of keeping. Oh, do come in. Yeah, please. Of course. - Thank you. - You lead the way. Go ahead. Go ahead. - Take a left. - All right. I really hate to think how... it would hurt Justin if he knew. I've violated his code, Ham, in the most cynical way. And the end... that justifies my means? I need this creep to help me blackmail Her Majesty's government. Please tell me I'm not a ruthless bitch. Please tell me that Justin would understand if he knew. If you give me the wrong answer, then I will push you into the Tiber... like I did when we were 16. Ciao, my darling. - Thank you. - For what? For this wonderful gift. How very generous of me. No, I... Here, Justin, put this on. I like it here. This is where you work from? Mm. Amnesty. Won't make any difference. That's the official line of the Foreign Office. I thought you were like that."

Four days ago he lunched in London with Pellegrin, who describes him as overwrought, after which he visited his wife's lawyer... before going off our radar. The poor man seems to have convinced himself... there was a conspiracy against Tessa in which we are all complicit. If he has left the U.K., he did so without a passport. Therefore, any contact from Justin must be reported to me immediately. In his own best interest. No point asking if you've heard from him, I suppose? No, no, Tim, none at all. Birgit, why are ThreeBees spending $70 million testing Dypraxa for KDH? I mean, is the African market worth that much? Tessa, you have to understand the scale of this. There is a T.B. Epidemic coming. It will affect the entire world. Or, put into the language that stock exchanges all over the world understand, if the T.B.

Then why are you showing me this? Let's just say if I'm going to the wall. I want a trophy. That's what you lot do, isn't it? Heads on walls. I think I'll have Pellegrin's fucking head on mine.

She won't. You do have another friend, believe it or not. You won't find what you're looking for in Loki. Let's be honest with each other, shall we? That's a... a late career change for you, Tim. There's something else we have in common, you and I. We'll both be dead by Christmas. There's a contract out on you. Same people who did for Tessa, I shouldn't wonder. Mine's cancer. My pain is controllable. I knew that you were ill. I'm sorry. I didn't realize. Yeah. Sandy tell you? He fingered Tessa. He said he'd made a phone call. He didn't know they'd kill her. Silly sod was besotted with her. But that's the way it works with corporate murder. Boss gets wind of something, calls in his head of security, who talks to someone, who talks to a friend of someone.

Look, there are thousands of them out there. I can't make an exception for this one child. This is one we can help. Here. Abuk. Abuk. Abuk. Listen, that's the way it is here. Keep your money. Strap yourself in, and let's go. What'll happen to her? She might make it to a refugee camp... if she's lucky. This is what you came for, I believe. Your wife would have made that tape public, Mr. Quayle, with my voice on it. That letter was my insurance policy. But how did they know where to find her? They were on their way to Marsabit, taking the whole rotten package... to Grace Makanga. Makanga would have put it in front of the U.N. But someone knew exactly where Tessa and Arnold would be. That was me. I radioed Nairobi. KDH security man name of Crick. God, Christ, man. I didn't know they were gonna be murdered. My oath to God. Crick's going to know that you were up here. Going to be very interested to know where you're headed. What do I tell him? He'll know. He's been there before. - Mr. Andika? - Yeah? I'd like to apologize if I embarrassed you earlier. It's all right. Do you think that it would be possible to land the plane here? Lake Turkana? It's possible, but you don't wanna go there. It's... nothing there but crocodiles. Let me take you back to Loki. Well, I... I wouldn't be alone for long. Please. I'd be, um... I'd be grateful. I have one more favor to ask you, I'm sorry. Do you think you could post that envelope for me?",

        "- What were Tessa and Bluhm... doing at Lake Turkana? Are you crazy? We've got to get out of here, man. I mean, these people, they kill anybody. Sorry. Have you lost your senses? There was something else. There was a letter. Look, you're a lunatic. Do you know what you're doing? - You're killing us both. - We'll take our chances with them. No. Get down... Abuk. Abuk. You okay? Come with us, quick. Run. Run. Wait. Wait. Be careful. Abuk, be careful. Here. Hurry on up. Where have you guys been? Sorry about that, Jonah. - I'm sorry.

If we have lost in Justin and Tessa... two valued friends, the diplomatic community has lost a true gentleman... courteous, self-effacing, large of heart. That he chose to take his own life in the same remote spot... where Tessa met her tragic death... is a sad reflection of his tormented state of mind... but also typical of his discretion. He would not have had us troubled. He would not have had us inconvenienced. Nothing in his life became him... like the leaving it. I have, uh, chosen a text I know Justin and Tessa would approve. It's an epistle. Noncanonical. My dear Sandy, your naivety is beyond belief. 'Knowing our arrangements with KDH and ThreeBees, 'you send me this half-baked report... 'by some bleeding heart diplomatic wife and her black lover... 'and ask me to take action. 'The only action required, apart from shredding the thing, 'is to keep a tighter rein on your resident harlot. 'I want to know what she does, where she goes, whom she meets. 'The issue here is deniability. 'If nobody told us Dypraxa was causing deaths, 'we can't be held responsible. 'But, my dear Sandy, should it ever become known... 'that we've closed our eyes to the deaths, 'none of us would survive the scandal. 'I still have great hopes of you. My love to Gloria. Yours Sincerely, Bernard.' This way, sir. What do you have to say, sir? It was a bizarre sort of suicide. His body bore no fewer than eight bullet wounds... from three different guns, none of which was the one found in his hand. So who has got away with murder? Not, of course, the British government. They merely covered up, as one does, the offensive corpses. Though not literally. That was done by person or persons unknown. So who has committed murder? Not, of course, the highly respectable firm of KDH Pharmaceutical, which has enjoyed record profits this quarter... and has now licensed ZimbaMed of Harare... to continue testing Dypraxa in Africa. No, there are no murders in Africa. Only regrettable deaths. And from those deaths we derive the benefits of civilization, benefits we can afford so easily... because those lives were bought so cheaply. I know all your secrets, Tess. I think I understand you now. You want me to come home. But I am home.\n\nMr. Quayle. Tess.",
