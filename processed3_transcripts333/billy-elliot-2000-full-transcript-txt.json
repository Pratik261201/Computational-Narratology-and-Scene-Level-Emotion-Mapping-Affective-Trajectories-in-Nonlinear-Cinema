If Dad knew you smoked that stuff, he'd go mental. What? Fuck off, will you? Twat. Here we go, Dad! Come on, man. Dad! Hurry up, Dad, man. We'll be late. I'm telling you, the whole frigging world's gonna be on that picket line this morning. Oi! You tidy our room. Dad! There's not much of this coal left. It's fine. We'll be digging it up again next month. Don't kid yourself. I'm not waiting for youse. Tony. Tony! See you down the picket line, Dad. Leave it, Billy. Mom would've let us. Your 50 pence is on the fridge. Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Are you sure you're not going to come? Am I fuck. It's a right load of old bollocks. No, it's not. It's a load of shite, kicking people in. Anyway, I don't know why you bother. - I'm good at it. - You're shite. Look at them gloves, man. They went out with the ark. They're me dad's, these. Exactly. Right, lads. Listen up here. Hold it! Oi, oi! Here! Now, because they're using downstairs as a soup kitchen for the striking miners, I'm going to let Mrs Wilkinson use the bottom end of the boxing hall for her ballet lessons. So no hanky-panky. Understood? Yes. Elliot, you're late. Get changed and get in here. All right then, lads. Now, give it all you got! Round one. Well, don't just stand there, Elliot! No! Not again! This is man-to-man combat, not a bloody tea dance. What're you doing, man? Hit him! Greavesy, he's just pissing about. Now, get stuck in and give him a belt. He's like a fanny in a fit. Billy, hit him! Jesus Christ, Billy Elliot! You're a disgrace to them gloves, your father, and the traditions of this boxing hall. You owe us 50 pence. Liberace, will you give it a rest? Billy, punch bag. You're not going until you do it properly. Give these to Mrs Wilkinson and her dance class when you've finished. I'll see you next week. Okay, girls. Left hand on the bar. Thank you, Mr Braithwaite. And... Pretty arms. Bottoms in. Where are you looking, Susan? Lift. Feel the music. Feel it. In time, Debbie, please. And one, and two, and three, and four, and five, six, seven, eight. And one, and two, and three, and four, five. And hold. Hold it. Support yourselves! Don't look at me.",

We used to watch him at the Palace Picture House, and then dance round the front room like lunatics. Marvelous! Mind, they used to say I could've been a professional. Come on, Grandma. Not now. Oh! Grandma! It's this one here! Grandma! It's over here! Tony, do you ever think about death? Fuck off! Night-night, then. Plenty of boys do ballet, you know? Do they now? What boys do ballet? Nobody around here, but plenty of men do. - Poofs. - Not necessarily poofs. Who, like? What about that Wayne Sleep? He's not a poof. He's as fit as an athlete. Bet he couldn't beat Daley Thompson. Maybe not in a race, but in stamina. Why don't you come tomorrow? - You can just watch. - I can't. Gotta go to boxing, haven't I? Please yourself, then. See you around. Aye, see you. Ta-ra.

I used to go to ballet. See? Aye, for your nana. For girls. Not for lads, Billy. Lads do football or boxing or wrestling! Not frigging ballet. What lads do wrestling? Don't start, Billy. I don't see what's wrong with it. You know perfectly well what's wrong with it. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. - No, I don't! - Yes, you bloody well do. Who do you think I am? You know quite nicely! What? What are you trying to say, Dad? You're asking for a hiding, Son. No, I'm not. Honest. You are, Billy. Billy! It's not just poofs, Dad. Some ballet dancers are as fit as athletes. What about that Wayne Sleep?",

First rule of a union, Gary. You never cross a picket line. We're all fucked if you forget that! We're fucked anyway. In a speech to Tory MPs yesterday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher referred to members of the striking National Union of Mineworkers as \"the enemy within\".

He's just under a lot of pressure. That's what Mom says. I think it's because he drinks too much. Does he drink too much, like? He's always pissed. Once he pissed himself. Your dad? 'Cause he's unhappy and that. 'Cause they sleep in separate beds. Why do they sleep in separate beds? So they can't have sex. Do they not have sex, like?

I don't know if they're right, Miss. If they're special to you, they're right. What are they for? To give us some ideas for a dance. Come on, then. Let's see them. What's that? It's a letter. I can see it's a letter. It's me mom's. She wrote it for when I was 18, but I opened it. Here. \"To my son Billy.\" \"Dear Billy.\" \"I know I must seem like a distant memory to you,\" \"which is probably a good thing.\" \"It will have been a long time,\" \"and I will have missed seeing you grow.\" \"Missed you crying, laughing,\" \"and shouting.\" \"I will have missed telling you off.\" \"But please know that I was always there.\" \"With you through everything.\" \"With you through everything.\" \"I always will be.\" \"And I am proud to have known you,\" \"and I am proud that you were mine.\" \"Always be yourself.\" \"I love you forever.\" \"Mom.\" She must've been a very special woman, your mother. No, she was just me mom. I brought tape and all. What is it? I Love to Boogie. It's one of our Tony's. Spin it! Go on! And tap. Go! Grandma, tea time. Where are you going? Go back to sleep. It's 4:00. You weren't thinking of taking it with you? If you just wanna stand round getting the shit kicked out of you, that's your funeral. But some of us are ready to fight back for once. They're already after you, for fuck's sake. You're no good to us in jail. I don't plan on getting caught. What's going on? You, get back to bed! Both of you! Fuck you. Put it down. You gonna stop me? I'm warning you. You haven't got it in you. You're finished! Since Mom died you're nothing but a useless twat. What the fuck are you gonna do about it? Stop it! What the fuck are you looking at? You haven't been practicing. Prepare. One, two. And one, and two... Get up. Miss, I can't do it. That's because you're not concentrating. I am concentrating. You're not even trying! I am, Miss! Do it again. Can't. You do it again. No! Shit! I'm sorry. It's all right for you. It's not you who has to do it!"

Can I put a tape on, Miss? All right, if you must. It's cush, isn't it? So, is there a story, then, Miss? Of course. It's about a woman who's captured by an evil magician. Sounds crap.

And then one night, she meets this young prince, and he falls in love with her. And she realizes, this is the one thing that will allow her to become a real woman once more. So then what happens? He promises to marry her and then goes off with someone else, of course. So she has to be a swan for good? She dies. Because the prince didn't love her? Come on. It's time to go. It's only a ghost story. Come on! No! No. No. It's me. It's Billy. Little one. Oi! Little one. What have I told you about drinking out of the bottle? Sorry, Mom. Well, put it back.

Lift out, and close. And one. Lift. When's the audition, then? Tomorrow morning. I'll miss you if you go away. Who do you think's better? Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers? Billy, do you not fancy us, like? Don't know. Never really thought about it. If you want, I'll show you me fanny. No. You're all right. Get inside! The union leader! Get him! Get down! Thanks, pet.
