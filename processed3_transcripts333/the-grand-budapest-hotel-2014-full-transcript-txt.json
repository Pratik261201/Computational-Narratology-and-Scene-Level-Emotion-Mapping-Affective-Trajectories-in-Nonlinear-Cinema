      "raw_text": "It is an extremely common mistake, people think the writer's imagination is always at work, that he's constantly inventing an endless supply of incidents and episodes, that he simply dreams up his stories out of thin air. In point of fact, the opposite is true. Once the public knows you're a writer, they bring the characters and events to you and as long as you maintain your ability to look and to carefully listen, these stories will continue to... Stop it. Stop it! Don't! Don't do it! Will continue to seek you out over your lifetime. To him who has often told the tales of others, many tales will be told. - Sorry. - It's all right. The incidents that follow were described to me exactly as I present them here and in a wholly unexpected way. A number of years ago, while suffering from a mild case of \"Scribe's Fever,\" a form of neurasthenia common among the intelligentsia of that time, I decided to spend the month of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz, and had taken up rooms in the Grand Budapest, a picturesque, elaborate, and once widely celebrated establishment. I expect some of you will know it. It was off season and, by that time, decidedly out of fashion, and it had already begun its descent into shabbiness and eventual demolition. What few guests we were had quickly come to recognize one another by sight as the only living souls residing in the vast establishment, although I do not believe any acquaintance among our number had proceeded beyond the polite nods we exchanged as we passed in the Palm Court, in the Arabian baths, and onboard the Colonnade Funicular. We were a very reserved group, it seemed, and, without exception, solitary. Perhaps as a result of this general silence, I had established a casual and bantering familiarity with the hotel's concierge, a West-continental known only as Monsieur Jean, who struck one as being, at once, both lazy and, really, quite accommodating. I expect he was not well paid. In any case, one evening, as I stood conferring elbow-to-elbow with Monsieur Jean, as had become my habit, I noticed a new presence in our company. A small, elderly man, smartly dressed, with an exceptionally lively, intelligent face and an immediately perceptible air of sadness.",

Who's this interesting old fellow? I inquired of Monsieur Jean. To my surprise, he was distinctly taken aback. - Don't you know? - He asked. Don't you recognize him? He did look familiar. That's Mr. Moustafa himself. He arrived earlier this morning. This name will no doubt be familiar to the more seasoned persons among you. Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time the richest man in Zubrowka, and was still indeed the owner of the Grand Budapest. He often comes and stays a week or more, three times a year at least, but never in the season. Monsieur Jean signaled to me and I leaned closer. I'll tell you a secret. He takes only a single-bed sleeping room without a bath in the rear corner of the top floor and it's smaller than the service elevator! It was well known, Zero Moustafa had purchased and famously inhabited some of the most lavish castles and palazzos on the continent. Yet here, in his own nearly empty hotel, he occupied a servant's quarters? At that moment, the curtain rose on a parenthetical, domestic drama... Shit. which required the immediate and complete attention of Monsieur Jean, but, frankly, did not hold mine for long. However, this premature intermission in the story of the curious, old man had left me, as the expression goes, \"gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen,\" that is, on the edge of my seat, where I remained throughout the next morning, until, in what I have found to be its mysterious and utterly reliable fashion, fate, once again, intervened on my behalf. I admire your work. I beg your pardon? I said, I know and admire your wonderful work. Thank you most kindly, sir. Did Monsieur Jean have a word or two to share with you about the aged proprietor of this establishment? I must confess, I did myself inquire about you. He's perfectly capable, of course, Monsieur Jean but we can't claim he's a first, or, in earnest, even second-rate concierge. But there it is. Times have changed. The thermal baths are very beautiful. They were in their first condition. It couldn't be maintained, of course. Too decadent for current tastes. But I love it all just the same, this enchanting old ruin.",

Junior Lobby Boy in-training, Grand Budapest Hotel, under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H. I became his pupil, and he was to be my counselor and guardian. What is a Lobby Boy?",

Well, who wouldn't, at the Grand Budapest, sir? It's an institution. Very good. - A thousand Klubecks. - My goodness. Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir? What do you think? Well, I suppose you'd have to start somewhere... - Go and light the goddamn candle. - Yes, sir. And so, my life began. Junior Lobby Boy in-training, Grand Budapest Hotel, under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H. I became his pupil, and he was to be my counselor and guardian. What is a Lobby Boy?"

Tell Zero if you see any funny business. \"Your devoted Monsieur Gustave.\" Then there's a poem, but we might want to start on the soup since it's 46 stanzas. \"A moist, black ash dampens the filth of a dung-dark rat's nest \"and mingles with the thick scent of wood rot \"while the lark song of a guttersnipe...\" I never trusted that butler. - He's too honest. - Too honest, you say? Right, well, be that as it may, find him quick and make it snappy. May I offer any of you inmates a plate of mush? No? Anyone? You with the very large scar on your face? Try it. It's actually quite warm and nourishing this morning. It needs a dash of salt. Good day. Mush, gents?"

Who drew this? What do you mean, \"Who drew this?\" I did. Very good. You've got a wonderful line, Ludwig. This shows great artistic promise. Question, how do you intend to penetrate this lowest rudiment? It's 25 inches of reinforced granite masonry, is it not? Digging with the throat-slitter, I expect this would take three to six months of continual effort, during which time several of our members will have been violently executed. You hit the nail on the head, Mr. Gustave. We got fake documents, second-hand street clothes, a rope ladder made of sticks and bunk-linens, but we need digging tools, which are proving hard to come by in this flop-house. At this point in the story, the old man fell silent and pushed away his saddle of lamb. His eyes went blank as two stones. I could see he was in distress. - Are you ill, Mr. Moustafa? - I finally asked. - Oh, dear me, no. - He said. It's only that I don't know how to proceed. He was crying.

That's a good sign, you know. It means she \"gets it.\" That's important. Don't flirt with her. A radio telegram was delivered and signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM. The envelope was found near the body, but its contents were missing. However, the telegraph office always keeps a carbon of the ticker tape for 24 hours. I copied it down. It reads as follows, \"Pack your things stop. \"Be ready to leave at moment's notice stop. \"Hide-out is vicinity of Gabelmeister's Peak stop. \"Destroy this message all my love full stop.\" Where's the basket? Where you headed, mister? Skiing? Sledding? Mountain climbing? Three Klubecks. By express wireless, I wrote Agatha with instructions to move to our pre-arranged hideout, a Gypsy caravan on the outer Nebelsbad road, while Monsieur Gustave and I continued east into the Zubrowkian Alps, toward our high-altitude rendezvous with the butler Serge X. As a precaution, we disembarked quietly in the freight yard just outside the station. L'air de Panache. It's a hell of a view. I give them that, for what's it's worth. I agree. \"'Tis oft'-remarked, no single, falling-flake does any other - \"in its pure and perfect form...\" - Somebody's coming. Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? - Uh-huh. - Get on the next cable car. Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? - Uh-huh. - Switch with me. Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? - Uh-huh. - Put these on and sing. - Are you Monsieur Gustave of the... - Yes, dammit. Confess. I'm innocent. Hmm? No, no. Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave. I never meant to betray you. They threatened my life and now they've murdered my only family. No. Who did they kill this time? - My dear sister. - The girl with the club foot? - Yes. - Those fuckers! I tried to warn you at the beginning. I know, darling. Let's put that behind us. Listen, I hate to put you on the spot, but I really must ask you to clear my name. - Obviously you're grieving... - There's more. - To the story. - I get it. Go on. I was the official witness in Madame D's presence to the creation of a second will to be executed only in the event of her death by murder."
