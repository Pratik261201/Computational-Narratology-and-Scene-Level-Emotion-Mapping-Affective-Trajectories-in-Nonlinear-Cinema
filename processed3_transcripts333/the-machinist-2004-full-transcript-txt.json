I'm tired but thanks. Let's go, monkeys. Watch your work, not your ass. Come on guys, keep it moving. Yes sir, yes sir, Master Tucker, motherfucker. Hey, why is that machine down? - I am cleaning this. - It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill. Where am I going to make up that 7 minutes, Miller? Your paycheck? - Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations. - What regulations? Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning and maintenance of all heavy machinery. Ocean, 1989. Yeah? Write to your congressman and hurry that up. Congratulations, Reznik. You just made my shitlist. She copping his joint, right? And he's tellin' her, you know, baby this, baby that... Chatting her up like mother fucking Barry White. Talking about what he going to do to her, and how he going to make her coochy feel and all that. That's right. So then, she stopped. She looked up at him with these big old puppy eyes she's like... That sounds good pappy, but me no have no coochy. So, my man's like \"Say what?!\" He looked down and realised that she is a he! Man, that's bullshit! You mean to tell me that the whore was wearing nothing but a thong and this fool can't tell no difference? Hey, man. he had one of them \"tuck jobs\". Come on Jones, you know how they do that. You might, I don't! Yeah, whatever. You Reznik, you wanna go for some cards tonight? Can't, got plans. Shit! See, this nigger say the same thing every poker night. Hey, what's up with you? You used to be alright. Well, he used to hang but he ain't never been alright. You need to realise, Jackson, that some men prefer the company of women. Who! Howdy duty, he don't get no booty. Maybe he has got a date by the name \"tuck jobs\". No, your mother said she couldn't make it. Oh! Reznik talking smack, I can't even respond to that. You okay? Do I look okay? If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist. What's wrong? I don't know, déjà vu. You are tired, you need to sleep. How do you do it? What? Sleep so little and still look so good. Are you flirting with me? Commiserating. - Try to fatten me up? - What if I am? Suppose I wanted blueberry. You had that last night.",

Are you doing drugs, Reznik? Where is the shop steward? He couldn't make it. - Shouldn't even be in here without a union. - See what I mean. Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, believe me, but there's absolutely nothing to worry about. Then I'll just get back to work. Trevor, not yet. I need to ask you for a UA. Look like rain.

Okay. My ex, he's a fucking Psycho. Trevor, I'm worried about you. Don't worry, no one ever died of insomnia. I hope not, you are my best client. Can't afford to lose ya. Gee, thanks. Reznik, I need a hand. Gotta get this dead level here, help me out. - Safety on? - Oh, yeah. How's that? No, still off. Is that any better? Hey, do your sleeping on your own time.

We some help over here! We need some help! Over here. - Come on man, come on. - What's happening here, man? Call an ambulance! What happened here? I was helping him level the belt. I thought the safety was on. You thought?! Somebody kill that fucking machine! Shit! Hello, Mrs. Shrike. I've come to pay rent. And so early. Oh, Mr Reznik, I only wish all my tenants are considerate as you. I will give you a receipt in the morning. Good night, Mr. Reznik. Mrs. Shrike, Forgive me, but... Have you noticed anyone hanging around my apartment? Has there been a burglary? No, no, no, nothing like that. I just wondered if... You know, if... you noticed anything unusual lately? Unusual? Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike. I am sorry to disturb you so late. Good night. What we know is this: One: Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves. Two: Miller's arm was in the cutting zone of mill while it was off. Three: the mill suddenly activates, catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this. What's the fucking point? These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik. Our job is to investigate these events from every possible angle... So that we might prevent their recurrence. So we'd appreciate it if you would be a bit more co-operative. I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake. What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik? I was distracted. By what? What distracted you? It was Ivan, I was watching Ivan on the pit. The whole thing is my fault, okay. Who did you say? The new arc welder, I don't know his last name. - What new arc welder? - Ivan, the guy from the swing shift. Reynolds was picked up on a warrant. This guy took his place. What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik? Reynolds is right over there on the pit as usual, busting his ass. There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik. What is this? Mr. Reznik, have you recently suffered any head injuries? Ever hear of pumpkin pie? No. - Trevor. - Yeah. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. Why do you go out of your way to come here every night? Is it out of the way? An airport? For coffee and pie? Suppose I went to Danni's... Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.",

I lost mine too. Still hurts. I am not so good at losing family. Who is? What's weird is that it didn't hit until I picked out her burial dress. I pictured her while buying it... Not knowing it would... You know, be the one. Seems unfair, doesn't it? Not knowing things like that. Hey, how about spending the day with me and Nicolas after the cemetery? Sounds dreamy.

You gotta go back to the shop. Tucker needs to see you. - What about? - I don't know, but it seemed important. Well, he's gonna have to wait. It's Miller time. We need to talk. Follow me. Come on! Another Bourbon. Make it double. You shooting coke or something? You look like a dope fiend to me. No offence. I don't use drugs. I mean I don't even drink. How about abnormally? I see Reynolds is back to work. Gets to make bail. I'll tell you one thing. Whatever he did, you sure ain't copping to it. Would you? Never trust a con, cowboy!

It's supposed to be my day and he gets all the fun. That's okay, when he's older, I'll let him make it up to me. A little guilt goes a long way. How about you? Cemetery. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Thanks. I lost mine too. Still hurts. I am not so good at losing family. Who is? What's weird is that it didn't hit until I picked out her burial dress. I pictured her while buying it... Not knowing it would... You know, be the one. Seems unfair, doesn't it? Not knowing things like that. Hey, how about spending the day with me and Nicolas after the cemetery? Sounds dreamy. Hey Reynolds, what did the Feds want you for? Armed robbery. Oh yeah, that's right, because me and Jackson had you pegged as a paedophile. Ain't that right, Jackson? Shit, probably guilty of that too. Hey, I don't see what's so fucking funny. Y'all clowning this motherfucker like it's some big joke. Well it ain't! Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you. You made me nervous. You look like shit, acting all crazy. What's up with you? Nothing is up with me. It was an accident and I am the one who gotta live with it, not you. You ain't hearing me, man. Nobody wants you here. Nobody. See you tomorrow. Hey! Hey! Howdy, partner. You gotta go back to the shop. Tucker needs to see you. - What about? - I don't know, but it seemed important. Well, he's gonna have to wait. It's Miller time. We need to talk. Follow me. Come on! Another Bourbon. Make it double. You shooting coke or something? You look like a dope fiend to me. No offence. I don't use drugs. I mean I don't even drink. How about abnormally? I see Reynolds is back to work. Gets to make bail. I'll tell you one thing. Whatever he did, you sure ain't copping to it. Would you? Never trust a con, cowboy! They ain't get through life being honest. Where they hiding you these days? Around. Hey, you wanna see something? Look at that. Lost them on a lady. Yeah, they took the big toe from the left foot and a pinky from my right."

I need to be doing something. Can't go watching soap operas all day. That hydro will be here tomorrow. You won't. Listen to the doctor. Margie, this is Reznik. The man who cost me my arm. How do you do, Mrs. Miller? I've been better, Mr. Reznik. Is there some place we can talk? Check it out. It's a beauty. 8 cylinders. MagnoSphere. Speed sensitive steering. ABS breaking with road texture and tension. Defence lock-up helps you maintain control in emergencies. Of course, it's an automatic. Hell I wanted a stick... but I figured my shifting abilities wouldn't be so hot. You know I am not at National any more, right? Yeah, I heard about it. It sounds like you almost lost one yourself, huh? Did you find that a bit ironic, Miller? Ironic? I'm sorry kid, I never got over sixth grade. I'll break it down for you, Miller. Moments after you left the shop, someone powered up my machine. With my arm in it. I nearly got killed. Accidents happen. It wasn't an accident. Accidents happen out of negligence. This happened out of spite. Hell, that's some vocabulary you got, kid. Spite. Ill will, vengeance. Vengeance means revenge, Miller. I'm sure you know what revenge means, don't you? I'm onto you Miller. Despite your stupid jokes, you secretly blame me for the accident. New car, or not, you despise me for it. How did you get into my place? Duplicate keys? Credit card? What? Fuck you, Miller! This shit's gonna stop! Get off my property, punk! Bastards. Shit. Come on. Come on. Come on. 7-4... 3-C-R-N. 743CRN. What? Shit. Fuck! I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide... motorist information to the general public. I'm not just a member of the general public. This guy is a friend of mine. But you don't know your friend's address? We just met, I don't know him that well. Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service. I just want talk to him. I'm sorry sir, I can't help you unless a crime has been committed. Has a crime been committed? Please, I wouldn't ask if it weren't extremely important. Sorry sir. No crime, no information. What if I told you I was hit by this car? I don't see any bruises. If you did, would you give me an address?",

You'll have to pay your utility bills, partner. You know how difficult it is shavin' in the dark. What have you done with Nicholas? What have I done with Nicholas? He can't hear you now, pal. Oh, come on. You know he's dead. Yeah. You ought to do something with that faulty memory of yours, pal. Might make your life a little bit easier. By the way, I just love them little notes you leave for yourself. That one on the refrigerator just kills me. Where is your hospitality, partner? If someone walks in, he might get the wrong idea. Who are you? Well, looks like you got some explaining to do, partner. I know who you are. I know who you are. I know who you are. I know who you are. You going somewhere, Mr. Reznik? Yeah, Mrs. shrike, I'm moving. I didn't receive notice. Your lease requires you to give 30 days notice in writing. It wasn't planned, something came up. You can keep my security deposit. I won't be needing it anyway. Really, Mr. Reznik? You used to be such a good tenant. I just don't understand it. Oh, isn't that pretty? Would you care to sell it? No, it was my mother's. I've made arrangements to donate all my things. A truck will be coming by this afternoon. If you're just going to give it away... If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Shrike. I'm in a bit of a hurry. I like to report a hit-and-run. I'm still gonna need to record your statement. Later, right now I just want to... Just want to sleep.",
