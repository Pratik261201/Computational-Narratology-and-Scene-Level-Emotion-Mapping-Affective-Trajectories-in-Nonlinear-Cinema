      "raw_text": "UFF? Easy going, they only killed 50 people. He was finished. To do that in LVF territory... You mean by a fecking... You know I hate balmy wars. Now he's attacked by UDA men. Heavens, EvF came for them and that was that, sort of. The ARB's dead and gone. And then he was red hot and on the run underground. I don't know the provost. - You have the whole story. - Rid IRA? You're nuts. They don't know how to make a bomb. A poet told a story of a boy walking under ice, shooting a man as he ate his breakfast, an ulster fry. Then he turned to his wife and said: \"Sorry, Mum.\" To understand Northern Ireland, you have to realize a strange war was fought here. There were no heroes, no defining battles. Only casualties. People die defending their daily lives, not always their causes. The trouble with The Troubles is you can't put a border between neighbors. Then the story was told again. This time better. They flew in in jets, talked up a ceasefire and told us that it was all over now. The past is in the past. Let it sleep. This is Belfast, and this is a Belfast story. Lost years. And it still echoes. Right this way, sir. Chief Constable wanted to brief you personally, about the scene. Mistake dug this house years ago. So many cold rainy nights. Always. Always raining. This way, sir. Ah, James. - So glad you could make it. - Mm. Come inside. - You too, um... - Damien, sir. What we have here is a gruesome motiveless murder of an old pensioner, to make matters worse. Pardon, sir, but this address has history. Well, yes, a connection was never proven so we'll have to leave that. We wouldn't want to start the press on political bias again, would we? And the important thing is you apply all your undoubted skills to find the killer and dealing with any of the intricacies this case may present. Now I see why I've been plucked off the scrap heap. The problem has raised it's ugly head, eh? And the motives go way back. Deep. And that got said, you need someone for damage control. Someone is about to disappear anyway. Someone about to retire. Someone like me. You know what your problem is, James? You have exactly the wrong kind of intelligence. You're too clever just to take orders. You have to look behind them. But then you're not smart enough to benefit from your knowledge.",

And neighbors reported an explosion at approximately 4 a.m. It was in an empty room on a chair surrounded by needles. Messy. Very messy. I'll find him. Show James the lead, Damien. In the unused bedroom, a great deal of money was found and a note. And it read, \"Official receipt for expenses. Two-hundred and fifty thousand pounds removed from known criminal revenue.\" And scrawled below it was the word justice. Did you count the rest? Five hundred thousand pounds remain. Well, you can add that to your sob story then. They took a third of his pension. I'm gonna leave you to get on with your work, James. I'm assigning Damien here to assist you with any leg work or paper filing. Any resources you need, consider them yours. I have to be away. I have a small speech to prepare. There was two of them. How do you know? A lot of nails to carry up the stairs and one of them had to watch your man while the other dug the money out. Could that have been done afterwards? After the explosion? You don't hang around after a bang like that. They crouched in the garden, waiting for something. My guess is the old man got up bright and early. They were waiting for a light. What makes you think he was awake when they came? The bed sheets weren't ruffled. Nobody was dragged out of that bed. No. They waited for a light and they melted the bolt and charged up the stairs. Then what happened? They tied him to the chair. Tied? Aye. Why else would he have been so close to the blast? It also fits the executionary style. Near the nail bolt. That was his weapon of choice back in the day. These boys were sending a message. After that, the money? Aye. One of them would have stood over him, while the other went to look for the money. What kind of justice is that? This is Belfast. Sir? Are you coming? I'm sorry, sir. It's just that you need to know there's been a murder. I've just taken the call. An elderly IRA veteran was killed in his home. It was a bomb. Oh, not now. The Chief Constable says he'll sit on it for as long as he can. I just can't help him again. We've suffered enough. I thought you'd want to know right away.",

It wouldn't surprise me if the IRA deal with us before we get a chance to. That's what I'm afraid of. Another war. Get in, will you? Well, as you can see, I stopped walking my son to school. It's a dangerous world out there. I saw him once. He was coming out the court out of the amnesty. I was on the beat, holding back the victim's relatives. Never seen such contempt read large in someone's face. So someone is definitely hunting down ex-IRA men. Aye. Unh! Someone with a grievance. And a sense of irony. You sound as if you think something like this could be justified. Vigilantes can never be justified. You're a man of old principle. Just a man of principle. Not too many of them around, that's all. So it's been a while since you've come looking for me. Must be needing something done. Aye. You've heard about the killings? Who hasn't? Except those that don't matter. What do you reckon? Could be nothing, could be a paramilitary shade. One death in this city is either unnoticed or the start of some shit storm. Anyway, you didn't come here for my political assessment. - What do you want? - I want you to look around. Check out the usual agents. Warn them off or just tell youse all about it? Just call in, Eammon. We're in a different business these days. The end of the alley from hereabouts, one of these houses. They never would've ventured further that way. They knew someone in here.

You know, if it were me against some sophisticated target, I would've gone for a roadside. If it was me, I'll never go near a car again. Then you never think it will be you. I can't have it.

Tell them you thought you heard someone tampering with the car. And then take Marian and get a taxi to your sisters. Kelly? Yeah, it's me. I need a spin. Right now, yeah? They think they're so smart, these boys. Reckon that I would drive my car without checking it proper? It's not that easy. You know, if it were me against some sophisticated target, I would've gone for a roadside. If it was me, I'll never go near a car again. Then you never think it will be you. I can't have it. The press are going wild. I want this bloody mess cleared up. And I want an assurance we are not going back there. Not on my watch. Sir, it's difficult to discern a clear pattern."

He says that South Ireland doesn't have the resources for taking action on this sort of thing anymore. He wants us to throw our weight behind our Unionist detectives. And, by any means possible, put a stop to these killings. But that's just what we've been on. It's worse. He's admitting the UIR can't handle these lads. They've met their match in the rough stuff department. And are appealing to friends they made in the police force. He's made it clear he expects these friends to deliver. So, what's the problem? We keep doing what we've been doing, except... No. Not exactly. I didn't haul myself out of the same gutter Owen did before I played into the hands of others. It's a new dawn. I should have smelled it earlier. So, what are we to do? The IRA had become old men. Cringing politicians turned so legitimate they can't defend their own lies. We mailed them. But they're in no position to call in a favor. And, may never be again. We help James. Make it seem we're pushing him through. When he finds this new force of his, ha, ha, and he will, we let them finish the job that they started. They get their revenge and go home happy. And as we embrace a new Belfast without an IRA, we shall be left with those left standing. Sacrament most holy, sacrament divine, all praise and all thanksgiving be every moment thine. Through him, with him, in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all praise and honor are yours, Almighty Father. Forever and ever. Sorry, lads, we're a bit lost. Is there a petrol station near here? I knew you'd come. But what does it matter now? You've lost. You're the last of the loyalist scum. And no one wants you. You flatter yourselves like you came up like innocent victims. But you didn't.

And, by any means possible, put a stop to these killings. But that's just what we've been on. It's worse. He's admitting the UIR can't handle these lads. They've met their match in the rough stuff department. And are appealing to friends they made in the police force. He's made it clear he expects these friends to deliver. So, what's the problem? We keep doing what we've been doing, except... No. Not exactly. I didn't haul myself out of the same gutter Owen did before I played into the hands of others. It's a new dawn. I should have smelled it earlier. So, what are we to do? The IRA had become old men. Cringing politicians turned so legitimate they can't defend their own lies. We mailed them. But they're in no position to call in a favor. And, may never be again. We help James. Make it seem we're pushing him through. When he finds this new force of his, ha, ha, and he will, we let them finish the job that they started. They get their revenge and go home happy. And as we embrace a new Belfast without an IRA, we shall be left with those left standing. Sacrament most holy, sacrament divine, all praise and all thanksgiving be every moment thine. Through him, with him, in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all praise and honor are yours, Almighty Father. Forever and ever. Sorry, lads, we're a bit lost. Is there a petrol station near here? I knew you'd come. But what does it matter now? You've lost. You're the last of the loyalist scum. And no one wants you. You flatter yourselves like you came up like innocent victims. But you didn't. You came because you've lost your colony."

I wanted an Ireland free for all men. Neither of yous wanted that. So I'm gonna give you a chance to defend yourself with your favorite weapon.

So sorry not to have caught you earlier and saved you a trip. Wonderful news. I managed to fast track your retirement payment. You'll be clear of all this rot. - Sir, about the case... - Don't worry about that at all. I've had Damien here pick up all your files.
