You can write him a fan letter later. This isn't the best time. Come on. Jurek, where have you been hiding her? I don't know what to take. You always take too much. How many suitcases are you taking? What do you think, should I take uncle Szymon's portrait? Take it, don't take it, take what you like. Can't you see I'm worried sick? He'll come home, he'll be alright. I should have another case. Mama, Wladek is home! Thank God. Wladek! You're wounded? No, a little cut. It's nothing. I've been worried sick. I told her not to worry. You had your papers on you. If you'd been hit by a bomb, they'd know where to take you. Henryk, don't say things like that. God forbid. God forbid. Papa, Wladek is home. What did I tell you? What are you doing? Is anybody seeing my hat with the wide brim? They bombed us. We're off the air. Warsaw is not the only radio station. Pack, darling. Get your things packed. Where are we going? Out of Warsaw. Out of Warsaw where? You haven't heard? Heard what? Haven't you seen the paper? Where's the paper? I used it for packing. She used it for packing. The government moved to Lublin. All able-bodied men must leave the city, go across the river, set up a new line of defense. That's what it said. There is not anybody left in this building, only the women. The men have gone. What do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defense here? Wonder around lugging your suitcases? Pack, Wladek. There's no time for this. I'm not going anywhere. Good. I'm not going anywhere either. Don't be ridiculous, we've got to keep together. Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die in my own home, staying put. God forbid. Shut up, I've got something. Listen. ...from the BBC in London. The British government... having received no reply to the observations presented... to the German government... has declared war on nazi Germany. That's wonderful! Wonderful! It is expected that... ...within the next few hours, France will make a similar declaration. Poland is no longer alone. Wonderful, wonderful! Mama, that was a great dinner. Yes, it certainly was. When there's something to celebrate, you've got to make an effort.",

The sidewalk is forbidden for you. Go to the gutter. Have you seen this? What? What? I'm working. What? What is this? It's where they're going to put us. What do you mean \"put us\"? \"By order of the governor of the Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer concerning the establishment of the Jewish district in Warsaw. \"There'll be created a Jewish district in which all Jews living in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will have to reside. \" Look here. \"Jews living outside of the prescribed area will have to move to the Jewish district by 31 of October, 1940.\" They won't get all of us. It's too small. There's 400,000 of us in Warsaw. No, 360 thousand. So it will be easy. What am I supposed to do? You tell me. Mama? Mama, what is it? 20 zlotys! That's all we have left, 20 zlotys. What can I buy with 20 zlotys? I'm sick of cooking potatoes, potatoes, potatoes. That's the price. That's what I'm offering. My advice is to accept. You won't get more from anyone else. But it's a Bechstein, Mr. Liva! 2000 and my advice is to take it. What are you to do when you're hungry? Eat the piano? Get out, you dirty! What's the matter with you? Stop it! We'd rather give it away. Go on. Get out! Haven't you eaten today? What are you suffering from? You people are crazy. I'm doing you a favor. 2000 and I'm paying for the removal. I'm not even charging for the removal! You haven't eaten today. You're crazy. Take it. Hello. Hello. Hi. I didn't want to come. I didn't want to see all this, but... I couldn't stop myself. How are you doing? Fine. Good. No, not really. They arrested my cousin. Jurek says they'll let him out. This is disgraceful. It won't last long. Don't worry. That's what I said myself. It's too absurd. I should go. Well, I'll see you... soon. Good-bye. Well... to tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse. Where will we sleep? I sleep in the kitchen with the girls. You, Henryk and papa in here. Look. Come and look. Go away. Go away! Go away! Papa! Papa! Sell anything?",

        "Governor of the Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer. \" I won't wear it. I won't wear it. I'm not going to be branded. Let me see this. Does it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them? We're not going to get them. We're not going to wear them. You! Come here. Why haven't you greeted us? I'm sorry. The sidewalk is forbidden for you. Go to the gutter. Have you seen this? What? What? I'm working. What? What is this? It's where they're going to put us. What do you mean \"put us\"? \"By order of the governor of the Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer concerning the establishment of the Jewish district in Warsaw. \"There'll be created a Jewish district in which all Jews living in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will have to reside. \" Look here. \"Jews living outside of the prescribed area will have to move to the Jewish district by 31 of October, 1940.\" They won't get all of us. It's too small. There's 400,000 of us in Warsaw. No, 360 thousand. So it will be easy. What am I supposed to do? You tell me. Mama? Mama, what is it? 20 zlotys! That's all we have left, 20 zlotys. What can I buy with 20 zlotys? I'm sick of cooking potatoes, potatoes, potatoes. That's the price. That's what I'm offering. My advice is to accept. You won't get more from anyone else. But it's a Bechstein, Mr. Liva! 2000 and my advice is to take it. What are you to do when you're hungry? Eat the piano? Get out, you dirty! What's the matter with you? Stop it! We'd rather give it away. Go on. Get out! Haven't you eaten today? What are you suffering from? You people are crazy. I'm doing you a favor. 2000 and I'm paying for the removal. I'm not even charging for the removal! You haven't eaten today. You're crazy. Take it. Hello. Hello. Hi. I didn't want to come. I didn't want to see all this, but... I couldn't stop myself. How are you doing? Fine. Good. No, not really. They arrested my cousin. Jurek says they'll let him out. This is disgraceful. It won't last long. Don't worry. That's what I said myself. It's too absurd. I should go. Well, I'll see you... soon. Good-bye. Well... to tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse. Where will we sleep? I sleep in the kitchen with the girls. You, Henryk and papa in here. Look. Come and look. Go away. Go away! Go away! Papa! Papa! Sell anything?"

That's why I always say: \"Look on the bright side!\" Yes, I know. How's your back? Better. Better? Better not ask. Thank you. My pleasure. Won't help you anyway. Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

You. You. You. You. You. You. The others, put your clothes on and come back here. Bring your things with you. 15 kilos only. Where are you taking us? I'm sorry, I did my best.

No. You stay. I'll go. We came to say goodbye. We're going to stay with my mother in Otwocks. The baby is already there. It's safer. There's talk that the uprising will begin any day now. That man Szalas should be shot. He's been collecting money on your behalf all over Warsaw. Apparently people gave generously, so he collected a tidy sum. My God. The liver the size of a football.

        "It's the beginning of the end. Let's hope so. Come here. Be careful with it. That's it. Be careful. Still alive then? Here. Sausage, bread. You still got that vodka? How long is this meant to last? Not long now. I think I've got jaundice. Don't worry about that. It just makes you look funny. My grandfather was jilted by his girlfriend when he got jaundice. Drink up. Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks... Problems. Money. I've got to raise money to buy the food. I need things to sell, it's not easy. Here. Sell this. Food is more important than time. Oh, yes. I meant to tell you! The Allies have landed in France. Russians will be here soon. They'll beat the shit out of the Germans... any day now. Wladek? I knew it. I knew this would happen. I'll get a doctor. You can't. It's too dangerous. Dr. Luczak. We can trust him. Dorota, don't be ridiculous. He's a pediatrician. He's still a doctor. No. You stay. I'll go. We came to say goodbye. We're going to stay with my mother in Otwocks. The baby is already there. It's safer. There's talk that the uprising will begin any day now. That man Szalas should be shot. He's been collecting money on your behalf all over Warsaw. Apparently people gave generously, so he collected a tidy sum. My God. The liver the size of a football.
