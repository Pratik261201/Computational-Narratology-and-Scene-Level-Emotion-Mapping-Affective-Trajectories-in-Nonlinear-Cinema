Come back to me. Come back to me. Come back to me. Stick 'em up! Are you the sheriff in this here town? These are my tickle guns, and I'm gonna getcha! No! You want me to chase you? You better run! - Ah! - Oh! I remember moments in the middle. I love you. I hate you! And this was the end. Shhh... Come back to me. You come back to me. But now I'm not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrived. Good morning. Morning. Where is everyone? Okay. Well, let's get started. Today we are talking about Portuguese and why it sounds so different from the other Romance languages. The story of Portuguese begins in the kingdom of Galicia... - Sorry. - ... in the Middle Ages, where language was seen as an expression of art. Any news you want to share? Dr. Banks, can you turn the TV to a news channel? ...but police have already set up a blockade here around the area. As you can see, we've got just about as close as we can, but unfortunately, Montana right now is on complete lockdown. The object apparently touched down 40 minutes ago, just north of I-94. We 're waiting to hear if this is perhaps an experimental vessel or... Hold on, it... I'm learning that more objects like this have landed in as many as eight other locations around the world. Yes, can we? This is from a site in Hokkaido. This is worldwide. It is happening right now. Okay. Um... I'm sorry. Class is dismissed. You are an idiot! You drove right into me! You just ruined my car! For now, we're simply asking for cooperation while authorities assess the object. So, you're saying it's not ours? Do you even know if it's from Earth? We 're still collecting information. We're coordinating with other countries. We're not the only ones to have one of these in our backyard. If this is some sort of peaceful first contact, why send 12? Why not just one? Yeah, I know. I saw that, too. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I don't know, Mom. I'm watching the same news coverage you are. Well, Mom, please don't bother with that channel. How many times do I have to tell you? Those people are idiots.",

I'll take your cell phones. Cell phones! Follow me. Put these on. You're gonna wear them at all times. Sir, they're here. Louise Banks? Ian Donnelly? When was the last time either of you have eaten? - Last night. - Same. Last time you did something stressful? Does now count? Just saying... Uh, who was being carted off in the medevac? Not everyone is able to process experiences like this. I'm gonna get some blood from you and give you an immunization dose that covers a battery of bacterial threats. Could you sign these, please? And roll up your sleeves. Either of you claustrophobic? - No. - No. Currently taking any medications? Allergies? Pregnant? No. The booster is a kick to your system, so you may experience some side effects, nausea, dizziness, headaches, a ringing in your ears, like you have tinnitus. They wouldn't go, either way. You see what's happening to him? How does this even work? The readings do not change, but I don't know, it's like we're insects on a piece of paper, and they're easing us out of the house. At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds, gravity starts to shift and slides us out of the room. Have you found a scientific explanation for it? Like, is it for them? Uh, no. We think it's for us. Air doesn't seem to circulate inside the chamber, so after about two hours, we run out of oxygen. It doesn't take 18 hours to pump fresh air into a room. Atmosphere... Excuse me? If their atmosphere is different from Earth, it would certainly take hours to rebalance their O2 content and pressure for us every time they open their door. So, they could suffocate us if they wanted. This is Agent Halpern with the CIA. Let me get you two to your stations. Yes, sir. Remember, we need answers as soon as possible. What do they want? Where are they from? Why are they here? This is the priority. Everyone, this is Dr. Ian Donnelly. He'll be running this team here. Have they responded to anything? Shapes, patterns, numbers, Fibonacci?",

You see what's happening to him? How does this even work? The readings do not change, but I don't know, it's like we're insects on a piece of paper, and they're easing us out of the house. At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds, gravity starts to shift and slides us out of the room. Have you found a scientific explanation for it? Like, is it for them? Uh, no. We think it's for us. Air doesn't seem to circulate inside the chamber, so after about two hours, we run out of oxygen. It doesn't take 18 hours to pump fresh air into a room. Atmosphere... Excuse me? If their atmosphere is different from Earth, it would certainly take hours to rebalance their O2 content and pressure for us every time they open their door. So, they could suffocate us if they wanted. This is Agent Halpern with the CIA. Let me get you two to your stations. Yes, sir. Remember, we need answers as soon as possible. What do they want? Where are they from? Why are they here? This is the priority. Everyone, this is Dr. Ian Donnelly. He'll be running this team here. Have they responded to anything? Shapes, patterns, numbers, Fibonacci?"

Yep. How you feeling? Um... I need some sleep, but I'm fine. Yeah. You know, I was doing some reading, um, about this idea that if you immerse yourself into a foreign language, then you can actually rewire your brain. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Mm-hmm. The theory that, uh... It... It's the theory that, uh, the language you speak determines how you think and... Yeah. It affects how you see everything. It was, uh... I'm curious... Are you dreaming in their language? I may have had a few dreams, but I don't... I don't think that that makes me unfit to do this job. Did you sleep? A little. Do you know Mandarin? It is shifting. The voice you're about to hear belongs to a Chinese military chief... General Shang. Pull it up! We got a satellite feed here of who he's talking to, if you want to look. Wait, go back. Stop. He's saying that each of the 12 is offering advanced technology. Go back again. And play. Um... \"Our science team is attempting to decode the sets.\" \"Sets.\" I don't know what that means. Something about advantage, suits, honor and, uh, flowers. I don't... I don't know. That's all. I don't know what it means either. An hour ago, China mobilized forces. And now, Russia's following suit. Shang's about to start something. Following suit. Suits. Suits, honor, flowers... Colonel, those are all tile sets in mah-jongg. God, are they... Are they using a game to converse with their heptapods? Maybe. Why? Well, let's say that I taught them chess instead of English. Every conversation would be a game. Every idea expressed through opposition, victory, defeat. You see the problem? Hmm... If all I ever gave you was a hammer... Everything's a nail. We need to ask the big question. Ready or not. Yeah, I know, but between there and there. Well, it's time to go. Okay... Heptapods' purpose. Heptapod purpose Earth. What is your purpose? Do we only have Costello? Okay. There you are. What does it say? Offer weapon. You saw what they wrote! Using a word they don't fully understand. - Could be a request. - A warning. Enough! Louise? We don't know if they understand the difference between a weapon and a tool."
