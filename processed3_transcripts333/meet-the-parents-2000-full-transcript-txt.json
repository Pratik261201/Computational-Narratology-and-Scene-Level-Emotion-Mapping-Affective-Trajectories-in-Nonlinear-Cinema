I got a half-hour before I have to be back. So you wanna go have lunch? What are you doing? Um, nothing. I just love you so much. These last 10 months... have been the happiest of my life. Yeah, they've been amazing, but... What's going on? Nothing. I just... I just feel like, you know, we're so close. You're my best friend, and you're also the woman that I love, and... You OK, sweetie? You're acting weird. I just got a crick in my neck. I did CPR on a 300-pound crack head today. - Want me to massage your neck? - No, no. Honey, your kids are trying to tell you something! Oh, hold on. Oh, it's my sister. Hello. Hi. You're engaged? Congratulations! You're getting married in two weeks? That's... a little soon. Mom and Dad... really don't know Bob very well. Dad was OK with this? Wow. That was very thoughtful of him. I can't believe he knew to ask Dad's permission. Yeah. I'm just here with Greg. He's taking me to lunch. He's OK. I know you've got to go. All right. I love you. Bye. So, what's going on? Debbie's marrying that guy? Yeah. In two weeks. Dr. Bob of Denver. Isn't that great? Yeah, that's... Didn't they just meet a few months ago? Yeah, but he asked her and she said yes. Well, he asked my dad first. Yeah, I overheard that. So he had to ask his permission? No, he didn't have to. Bob just understood that Dad appreciates that. - Mm-hm. - Deb said that Dad loves him. Bob bought him the perfect gift that just won him over. Really. Huh, a gift. - Is it OK to X-ray this? - Yeah. It won't mutate. - Sir, that's not gonna fit. - Wait a second. It's too big. You got to check it. Raise your arms, sir. Look, I got an engagement ring in the bag, so I can't open it here, can't I just carry it on? If it don't fit through the frame, you ain't carrying it on the plane. 531, New York, La Guardia. Check it. Wait, wait, excuse me... Don't worry, it'll be waiting for you there. Welcome to La Guardia Airport. Please follow the signs... Excuse me. Hi. You lost my bag and there's a diamond ring inside it. I didn't lose your anything, sir. Put your address here and we'll ship it when it surfaces. And if it doesn't? Am I supposed to go the whole weekend with just these clothes?",

My dad sees smoking as a sign of weakness. - OK, I'll leave them in the car. - No! He'll check there. - Oh, gosh... - What...?! Yeah, the roof is probably a better idea. Oh, and... we're not living together. - I thought you said you told them. - Well... Hi, Daddy! Hi! - Oh, I missed you so much, Pamcake. - I missed you too, Popjack. Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Shortstack, shortstack, coming up! Pop-pop, pop-pop, pop-pop-pop! Where's my widdle girl? Mommy! My mom! Oh, you look so beautiful! So do you! Look at you! Oh, I'm sorry. Mom, Dad, this is Greg. - Hi, I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes. - It's great to meet you. - I'm Dina. Welcome to Oyster Bay. - Thanks. What you driving, a Ford? Uh, yeah. It's a Taurus. We were gonna get a mid-size, but I figure, hey, pulling down decent bucks, might as well go all out and pop for the full-size. True. Interesting color. You pick it? Oh, no, the guy at the counter. Why? Well, they say geniuses pick green. - But you didn't pick it. - Jack! Oh, yucky! What smells of old sour milk? Oh, poor Greg got spit up on by a baby. He didn't! He did, Ma, at Lost Luggage. The airline lost his bag. Oh! They didn't! Yeah, they did. - What about you, honey? - No, I carried on. That's my girl! It'll turn up, I'm sure. And Greg, meanwhile, anything you need, just ask, huh? That's right. Mi casa es su casa. Oh, thanks, Jack. You, too. Yeah, ha ha! Hey, Momma, looks great! Really? We spruced up for the wedding. This is so nice! We like it. Beautiful. Oh, now, Greg, you have a very unique last name. And we were curious, er, how do you pronounce it? Oh. Just like it's spelled. F-O-C-K-E-R. Focker. Hmm... Focker. Mm-hm. - I'll get it, honey. - Oh, thanks, Mom. Oh, there he is! Jinxy! Come here, baby! Come to Daddy, Jinxy! Come on, Jinxy! Come here. Come to Daddy. Come on. Oh! Taught him that in one week.",

      "raw_text": "This is Pam's cat, Jinxy. - Say hello. Wave to Greg. - Hello, Jinx. Attaboy! That took me another week. - My gosh! - I didn't know you had a cat. I left him here when I moved to Chicago. Your daddy's best friend! You won't believe it, he even taught him to use the potty. Dad, that's kinda weird. Why? Now we don't have to smell kitty litter. That's right. How did you teach the cat to use the toilet? Easy. I designed a litter box to put inside the toilet. Once he got used to it, I took it away. Oh! That's... Yeah, makes sense. But he doesn't like it. Every chance he gets he tries to squat and bury. I had to move all my plants. Plus you got another guy in the house to leave the seat up. He can't lift the seat. He lacks the strength and opposable thumbs. Ah, right. Opposable... Didn't think about that. Jinx is a house cat. He can't go out. He lacks survival skills. It's just one of those things. I don't think Greg will be playing with Jinxy. He hates cats. Pam, I don't hate cats. I don't... I just happen to be more of a dog lover. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's OK if you hate cats, Greg. I don't. I don't hate cats... at all. That's OK. Just be honest about it. There's some things I hate. I'm being honest, really. Like what? Why don't we let the kids freshen up? Greg, we'll get you something to wear from Jack's closet. OK. - Oh, honey. - Yeah? I'm so happy you're home, sweetheart. Me, too, Daddy. Hey, listen, be nice to this one, OK? I kinda like him. OK, I'll try. Thank you. Shirt fit OK, Greg? Fantastic. Thanks, Jack. Good. Tom Collins coming up. I wish you hadn't said that I hate cats. You do hate cats. But you didn't have to say right when we met. I'm sorry. It just slipped out. Get your red hot pu-pus! My goodness! What is that? Oh, that's just... a little something from me. Go ahead, open it up. Oh, look, honey. Greg brought us a present! Oh, isn't that nice? Look at this. It's a flower pot... with the dirt in it. Mm. Actually, the real gift is what's planted in the soil. The bulb of a Jerusalem Tulip. Which, I was told, is one of the rarest and most beautiful flowers in existence. Oh, right, right. Uh, the Jerusalem. From the Jerusalis tulipizius genus, yes, yes. Anyway, the guy said with regular watering it should bloom in six months. Well, we'll look forward to that.",

        "This is Pam's cat, Jinxy. - Say hello. Wave to Greg. - Hello, Jinx. Attaboy! That took me another week. - My gosh! - I didn't know you had a cat. I left him here when I moved to Chicago. Your daddy's best friend! You won't believe it, he even taught him to use the potty. Dad, that's kinda weird. Why? Now we don't have to smell kitty litter. That's right. How did you teach the cat to use the toilet? Easy. I designed a litter box to put inside the toilet. Once he got used to it, I took it away. Oh! That's... Yeah, makes sense. But he doesn't like it. Every chance he gets he tries to squat and bury. I had to move all my plants. Plus you got another guy in the house to leave the seat up. He can't lift the seat. He lacks the strength and opposable thumbs. Ah, right. Opposable... Didn't think about that. Jinx is a house cat. He can't go out. He lacks survival skills. It's just one of those things. I don't think Greg will be playing with Jinxy. He hates cats. Pam, I don't hate cats. I don't... I just happen to be more of a dog lover. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's OK if you hate cats, Greg. I don't.

Pam, it's not like I'm a rabbi or something. I've said grace at many... a dinner table. OK. Oh... dear God... Thank you. You are such a good God to us. A kind and gentle and... accommodating... God. And we thank you, O, sweet, sweet Lord of Hosts, for the... ..smorgasbord you have so aptly lain at our table this day... and each day... by day... Day by day... by day. O... dear Lord, three things we pray. To love thee more dearly, to see thee more clearly, to... follow thee more nearly, day by day... by day. Amen. Amen. Oh, Greg, that was lovely. Thank you, Greg. That was interesting, too. Oh. That's a... that's a lovely vase. It looks great. Let me guess, is that one of your secret cameras, too, huh? Ah-booga-booga-booga! Whooh! Greg... That urn holds the remains of Jack's mother. Oh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That... That's all right. You didn't know. I'm... That's our Gran-Gran. We like to think of her as watching over us as we eat. Love you, Ma. Miss you. Miss you every day. Oh, honey, why don't you read Greg your poem? Oh, no. He doesn't want to hear that. What? No, what poem? You see, when Jack had to retire for health reasons... That's a bunch of malarkey. ..The doctor thought it would be therapeutic if he expressed his emotions in an artistic way. You wrote a beautiful poem about your mother. Please, we really want to hear it. - Poem! Poem! - Please? All right. It's a work in progress. I'm still not happy with it. As soon as it's ready, I'm going to glaze it onto a plate and put it next to the urn. Nice. It's very special. My Mother... by Jack Byrnes. You gave me life, you gave me milk, you gave me courage."

No. - I mean, well, I don't... - Yes or no? Hey. Hey. Oh. What's the matter, you can't sleep? No, I'm just going over my answers from the polygraph test your dad gave me. - Oh, no, he didn't? - Yeah, he did. Well, did you lie to him? No! I mean... Well, he asked me if we were living together, I... What did you tell him? Nothing. Your mother walked in and I yanked the thingies off. Would you react like this if he shoved bamboo shoots up my nails? Or does he hook all your boyfriends up to his little machine? He doesn't need a machine. He's a human lie detector. What?

He interrogated double agents in the company. Oh, that's great. I was scared of your dad when he was a florist. It's wonderful to know I've got a CIA spy hunter on my ass. Would you stop? You're doing great, OK? This is a lot to take in, honey. I'm sorry. It's just weird. I know, but you're doing fine. I promise. - No! - What's wrong, sweetie? I forgot. I'm not supposed to let the snake out. You what? I told your dad I wouldn't touch you. Well, I'm not in junior high any more, OK? No, seriously. I wanna try to respect his rules, OK? OK. Fine. You go ahead and get some sleep and I'll see you in the morning. OK. Morning, Greg. Morning. Pam told me she let you in on a little secret of mine last night. Yes, she did. As long as you keep your mouth shut for the rest of your life, you're in no immediate danger. I won't tell. I'm just being humorous. Ha. That's funny. The fact is, Greg, with the knowledge you've been given you are now on the inside of what I like to call the Byrnes Family Circle of Trust.

Why would \"BBQ at Best Man's\" be weird? Oh, my God, Greg! I was sure I told you. Kevin is Bob's best man. This is his place. Kevin, your ex-fiancé? How does he know Bob? Well, they... went to Lacrosse Camp together, and Kevin was the one who introduced Bob to Debbie. Lacrosse Camp? I was able to salvage this wood from an old chapel in Nantucket. Wow! - The house is amazing. - Thank you. OK, the sun is out, the grill is hot and the pool is luke, so if I can interest you in a swim and a BBQ, just follow me. All right, Kevo. Right on schedule. - Bring it on! - Must've cost a fortune. - You OK, sweetie? - Yeah. I'm really sorry. I thought you knew. It's not a big deal. If I can handle a weekend without sex and cigarettes, I can handle your ex-fiancé. OK, thank you. For the floor you're walking on, I chose Bolivian wormwood. It works well in here. I have the Viking range and the twin Sub-Zs. They open up right there. Oh, I get it. Like, hidden. - Yeah, kinda blend in. - Great. Are you a home owner, Greg? No, no. I rent. Oh. So, things are going real well for you, aren't they, Kevo? Things have been going so great lately. I got in early on some wireless IPOs and the stuff just skyrocketed. Wow. Greg, what line of work are you in? I'm in healthcare. So you know what I mean. There's lots to be made with the biotech stuff. I don't have to tell you that. How's your portfolio? I'd say strong... to quite strong. Yeah, strike while the iron's hot. Now's the time. Greg's a male nurse. That's right. Thank you, Jack. Wow. That's great, to give something back like that. I'd love to do some volunteer work. The other day, I saw this dog, he had, like, a gimp, he couldn't... It made me feel terrible. I wished I could do something. Well, I get paid, but also it feels, you know, good, so it's kind of, everybody wins. What do you...? You're a Wall Street trader, an investment guy? I don't like to be painted with that brush. Yes, that's my job...",

He put his collar on an impostor, then spray-painted his tail, then he tried to beat us back to get rid of the evidence! Oh, no, he... Please tell me that's not true, Greg.

I'll get you...! Dad! Hey, hey! Dad! Calm down! Where's the cat?! - Cat got out! Cat got out! - All right... You spray-painted his tail to make him look like Jinxy, didn't you? What's he talking about? Hank Macatee called me and told me he found Jinxy. He put his collar on an impostor, then spray-painted his tail, then he tried to beat us back to get rid of the evidence!

Because you were seeking my approval? Yes. - Because you love Pam? - Yes. Do you want to marry her? Do you want to marry her? I did. Till I met you. What does that mean? I love your daughter. I love her more than anything. But frankly, sir, I'm terrified of being your son-in-law. This weekend has made me doubt that I could even survive in your family. I think you've got some serious issues. If I lighten up, would you consider marrying my daughter? Would you lighten up a lot?"

Will you be my son-in-law? Greg? I thought you were going back to Chicago. We had a little plane trouble. Plus, your dad caught up with me at the airport. Don't... don't worry, it's OK. We worked out a lot of our issues. You and my dad worked out a lot of your issues? He gave me his human lie detector thing, but I passed. - Good. - Yeah. And... then he proposed. Are you feeling all right? Listen... This weekend was a nightmare. Oh. I had this elaborate plan, but somewhere... between giving your sister a black eye and... setting the house on fire, it kind of went off track. I just... I love you. I love you so much.

Mew mew mew mew. Hi, Jinx... It's a ring. I like to think of it as a little circle of trust. Pam... Will you marry me? Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Attaboy, Greg. That \"circle of trust\" thing, that's mine. Well, looks like we've got another wedding to plan. Yup. Just got to do one more thing. - What's that? - Meet his parents. - Jack... - Honey, relax. I'm sure they're wonderful, fascinating people. Good night, Jack. I mean, they'd have to be, right? To name their son Gaylord Focker? Do you, Deborah Byrnes, take Robert Banks to be your wedded husband? Yes! I mean, I do! I now pronounce you man and wife. Let's just see if you really can flush the toilet, Jinxy. I knew it. Oh! Shit! I knew it. Damn! That's my future son-in-law. What do you think? Hello, Jack. Aw, look at that. Nice, Jack. Hi. What's that, Jack? What? You're a big, fat, CIA man, huh? Did they teach you THAT...?",
