It's just another earthquake. I'm right here. Right here. Okay. The clocks stopped at 1:17. There was a long shear of bright light, then a series of low concussions. I think it's October, but I can't be sure. I haven't kept a calendar for years. Each day is more gray than the one before. It is cold and growing colder as the world slowly dies. No animals have survived, and all the crops are long gone. Soon all the trees in the world will fall. The roads are peopled by refugees towing carts and gangs carrying weapons, looking for fuel and food. Within a year, there were fires on the ridges and deranged chanting. There has been cannibalism. Cannibalism is the great fear. Mostly I worry about food, always food. Food and the cold and our shoes. Sometimes I tell the boy old stories of courage and justice, difficult as they are to remember. All I know is the child is my warrant, and if he is not the word of God, then God never spoke. . . flea, you could land on Lady Liberty's torch. \"If you flicked your tongue like a chameleon, \"you could whip the food off your plate \"without using your hands. \"But what would your mother say? \"If you craned your neck like a crane, \"you'd have to stretch your arm way up \"to scratch your head. \"If you had eagle eyes, you could spot a running rabbit.\" Let's take a look. There could be something here. Corn or something. No. They ran out of food. Maybe there's some hayseeds in the hayloft. I doubt it. It's not what you think. They committed suicide. Why? You know why. Two left. One for you, one for me. You put it in your mouth and you point it up, just like I showed you. Okay. - Like this. - No. Then just pull the trigger. You got it? Is that okay? Okay. Are you hungry? - Thanks. - Here you go. - I'm thirsty. - Thirsty? Some water? Okay. Hey. You look pretty. Oh, no. No. No, we don't have to do this. - I don't want to do this. - I think we do. No, I don't want to do this. What kind of life is this? You got to push. No. Come on, Push. Quick! Get up! We got to run. Go. Stay low. Go, go. - Papa.Papa. - Let's go.

I told you not to look over there. What are you eating? Whatever we can find. Whatever you can find. Yeah. You ain't gonna shoot that thing. You ain't got but two shells. Maybe one. - And they'll hear the shot. - Maybe, but you won't, because it'll be through your skull and inside your brain before you can hear it. To hear it, you'll need a frontal lobe and things with names like colliculus and temporal gyrus, but you won't have them anymore because they'll just be soup. You a doctor? I'm not anything. We got a hurt man. It'd be worth your while. You look at him again and I'll shoot you in the head. That boy looks hungry. Why don't y'all come on to the truck? Get you something to eat. Ain't no need to be such a hard-ass. You don't have anything to eat. Come on. Let's go. I ain't going nowhere. You think I won't kill you? You're wrong. You know what I think? I think you're chicken-shit. You never killed a man in your life. - Where'd that come from? - Right there! Who's shooting? Let's go. Come on. - At the tree line! - Come on! - The two of you, that way. - Move quicker. - Move! - I think I see him. Let's go! Over there! You're okay. I'm right here. Let's go. I try to look like any common traveling killer, but my heart is hammering. When it comes to the boy, I have only one question. Can you do it when the time comes? All right? I won't let anything happen to you. I'll take care of you. And I'll kill anyone who touches you, because that's my job. You got to stop crying. We got to go now. We got to go find the cart. Come on. Take the gun. That's all we have left. I should've done it a long time ago. I should've done it when we had more bullets. I don't know why I listened to you. They're gonna catch up with us and they're going to kill us. They're gonna rape me, and then they're gonna rape your son and they're gonna kill us and eat us. - Whatever it takes... - Stop it. - I told you... - Stop it! I will do anything. Anything. Like what? I don't even know why I ask you. I should just go ahead and empty every goddamn bullet into my brain and leave you with nothing. - That's what I should do.",

Can't you spend one more night with me? - No, I have to go. - Why? Why do you have to go? Why? Why do you have to go? What am I gonna tell him? What am I gonna tell him? God. You go south. No. You keep him warm and you go south. You won't survive another winter here. Why won't you help me? Where are you going? You can't even see out there. I don't need to. I don't need to see. - I'm begging... - Don't. - Please. - No. Don't. She was gone, and the coldness of it was her final gift. But she died somewhere in the dark. There is no other tale to tell.

It means going in a straight line, which we can't. There aren't any crows, are there? - Just in books. - Yep, just in books. Do you think there could be crows somewhere? I think it's unlikely. Could they fly to Mars or someplace? You know what? Let's go back. What is it? Let's go. Let's go. Run. Run. Go! Go! No. No! Let's go. - No! - Let's go. Let's go. Run. Hey! Hey! Hold on! Stop!

The sea? I don't know, used to be. Wait. I'm sorry it's not blue. We'll be all right. We'll just keep heading south. What's on the other side? Nothing. There has to be something. Maybe there's a father and his little boy, and they're sitting on a beach, too. You all right? - What is it? What is it? - I don't feel too... Jesus! You're burning up. Sorry. It's okay. You didn't do anything wrong. I'm right here. I'm right here. Can I ask you a question? Of course. What would you do if I died? If you died, I'd want to die, too. So you could be with me? Yeah, so I could be with you. What are you doing? I'm going out to that boat. What are you gonna do? See what I can find for us. Here. You keep a good lookout. Okay? Okay. Stay warm. Hey! What the hell happened? - I'm sorry! - They took everything! Our food, my shoes. Son of a bitch! - It's okay. Listen, it's okay. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I didn't mean to. - It's okay. - I fell asleep. Listen, don't lose heart. We're gonna get it back. Get away from the cart. Put the knife down. Fuck you. I ain't putting down shit. - God damn you. - Papa, please don't kill the man! Please. All right. All right, I done what you said. - Please, Papa. - Listen to the boy. - How long you been following us? - Following you? - How long? - Nobody been fucking following you. I saw the cart in the sand, just took it, that's all."
