      "raw_text": "I always knew we were a fairly odd family. First there was me. Too tall. Too skinny. Too orange. My mum was lovely, but not like other mums. There was something solid about her. Something rectangular, busy and unsentimental. Her fashion icon was the Queen. Dad, well, he was more normal. He always seemed to have time on his hands. After giving up teaching university students on his 50th birthday, he was eternally available for a leisurely chat or to let me win at table tennis. - Ahh! - Oh, yes. And then there was Mum's brother, Uncle Desmond. Always impeccably dressed. He spent the days just, well, being Uncle Desmond. He was the most charming and least clever man you could ever meet. His mind was on other things, though we never found out what. And then, finally there was Catherine. Katie. Kit Kat. My sister. In a household of sensible jackets and haircuts there was this, well, what can I call her, nature thing. With her elfin eyes, her purple T-shirts and her eternally bare feet, she was then, and still is to me, about the most wonderful thing in the world. All in all, it was a pretty good childhood. Full of repeated rhythms and patterns. By the time I was 21, we were still having tea on the beach every single day. Skimming stones and eating sandwiches, summer and winter, no matter what the weather. Oh! And every Friday evening, a film, no matter what the weather. And then once a year, the dreaded New Year's Eve party. Yeah, I might just get one. You're absolutely gorgeous. I'm Katie. What am I drinking? This is very expensive stuff. - Cheers. - Cheers. Come on, it's nearly midnight. We're all going through. We're going through. Look, I've gotta find you a... Oh, God! Everyone makes little mistakes. It's fine. Come on. ...6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year! Happy New Year. Sorry. And so I woke up the next morning, hung-over, ashamed of myself, and not realising it was the day that would change my life forever. Get up, stupid. Dad wants you. Oh, hello. Sexy pyjamas. Ah, Tim, come in. Uh, do sit down. That's very formal. Well, um, yeah. This is an odd moment for me because I had the same moment with my father when I'd just turned 21, and after it, my life was never the same, so I approach it pretty, um, nervously. Okay. When you're ready.",

Well, more accurately, travel back in time. We can't travel into the future. This is such a weird joke. It's seriously not a joke. So you're saying that you and granddad, and his brothers - could all travel back in time? - Absolutely. - And you still do? - Absolutely. Although it's not as dramatic as it sounds. It's only in my own life. I can only go to places where I actually was and can remember. I can't kill Hitler or shag Helen of Troy, unfortunately. Okay, stop. Um... - If it's true, which it isn't. - Although it is. Although it isn't, obviously. But if it was, which it's not. Which it is. Which it isn't. But if it was, how would I... The \"How\" is the easy bit, in fact. You go into a dark place, big cupboards are very useful generally. Toilets, at a pinch. Then you clench your fists like this. Think of the moment you're going to and you'll find yourself there. After a bit of a stumble and a rumble and a tumble. Wow. Is as good a reaction as any. I think I plumped for \"fuck!\" but it was the '70s. No, this is so obviously a joke. It's not a joke. Why would I lie to someone I'm fairly fond of? Okay. But, when I come back downstairs after standing in a cupboard with my fists clenched, you're gonna be in so much trouble. Well, let's see, shall we? Mmm. Oh, and, Tim, try and do something interesting. So much trouble. I mean it. Really. Right. Wow! You all right, Tim? Yes. Yeah. Good, ace. Yeah. Good, come on. It's nearly midnight and we've got to find... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoo! Midnight. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year! Thank you, Tim. You're welcome, Polly. Does Mum know? Not a whistle. Strange. And what about the whole... Butterfly effect thing. What can I say? We don't seem to have messed up civilisation yet. It's gonna be a complicated year. It's gonna be a complicated life. What have you done with it? For me, it's books, books, books. I've read everything a man could wish to. Twice. Dickens three times.",

Utterly screwed up your grandfather's life. Left him without love or friends. I've never bumped into a genuinely happy rich person. It would be nice not to have to work. No, that's a real recipe for disaster. Look what happened to Uncle Fred. What happened to Uncle Fred? Absolutely sod all. Wasted his life. You have to use it for things that you really think will make your life the way you want it to be. Come on, really think about this. Well, to be honest, I suppose, at the moment, it would be just great if it could help me get a girlfriend. Wow. - Massive. - Yeah. The mothership. For me, it was always gonna be about love. And that summer I walked into the eye of the storm. Her name was Charlotte. Cousin of Kit Kat's handsome but nasty boyfriend Jimmy. And she was staying for two whole months. - Just one. - Not both of them. Tim, will you do my back? Absolutely! Very keen! Whoa! Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no. No, no, no. - Is it in my hair? - Yes! Tim. Will you do my back? Sure. Just give us a sec. Okay. Thank you. Now... Ooh. Nice. It's my area. It was a summer of suntan and torture. I invited my foolish friend Jay around for tennis because I thought he'd make me look good. Ah! Ow! I was wrong! - Ow! What are you doing? - Oh, no. Charlotte just made both of us look like idiots. Bad luck, Tim. How the hell are you meant to concentrate on your game? How are you meant to live your life with this sort of shit going down? It never got better until suddenly it was almost too late. Well, Charlotte, our final lunch. No! And it's been really, really lovely having you all summer. It has. Thank you. Thank you. It really has. Hasn't it, Desmond? Beg your pardon? Lovely having Charlotte here all summer. Charlotte? Who's Charlotte? Come on, darling. Charlotte, sitting next to you. - Oh, yes, of course. Of course. Charlotte. - Hi. Lovely to meet you. Have you enjoyed having Charlotte here all summer, Tim? Yeah. There goes August. I've introduced him to most things, haven't I? You did. You were much more sophisticated. In a quiet way, I like to think. Come in. - Charlotte. - Yeah! As it's your last night, can I ask you a question?",

It's just a shame you left it till the last night. You should have tried creeping along the corridor while we still had time. Okay, the \"last night\" was a bad idea? Very bad idea. It feels like an ever so slightly insulting afterthought. \"Last night\" was never going to work. All right. Good. I've got it. Come in. - Tim. Hi. - Charlotte. - Hi. - Sit down. I know you've probably suspected this, but over the last month I've fallen completely in love with you. Now obviously this was gonna happen because you're a goddess with that face and that hair, but even if you didn't have a nice face, and even if you had absolutely no hair because of some bizarre medical reason, I'd still adore you, and I... I just wondered whether, by any chance, you might share my feelings. Wow. I tell you what. Why don't we see how the summer goes and then you ask me again on my last night? - Your last night? - Yes. Try me on the last night. See what happens then, shall we? It's exciting. Right. No, it's a perfect plan. That's absolutely perfect. Last night. Last night. Thanks very much. Night-night, Timmy. Big lesson number one, all the time travel in the world can't make someone love you. Bye! So the love of my life just drove away. And the very next day it was my turn to leave. There you go. Don't spend it all at once. Thanks. Don't call too often, your mother doesn't like to be disturbed. Okay. Thanks. I caught the train to London in search of a future and a girlfriend. I was staying in St John's Wood, near Abbey Road, with a playwright friend of my dad's called Harry. It's always nice to have family connections when you're a new kid in town. What the fuck do you want? I'm James's son. Who? - James Lake. - What about him? He said you had a room. Go in there and wait. Quietly. I mean it, don't make a sound. Or I'll kill you.",

It feels like an ever so slightly insulting afterthought. \"Last night\" was never going to work. All right. Good. I've got it. Come in. - Tim. Hi. - Charlotte. - Hi. - Sit down. I know you've probably suspected this, but over the last month I've fallen completely in love with you. Now obviously this was gonna happen because you're a goddess with that face and that hair, but even if you didn't have a nice face, and even if you had absolutely no hair because of some bizarre medical reason, I'd still adore you, and I... I just wondered whether, by any chance, you might share my feelings. Wow. I tell you what. Why don't we see how the summer goes and then you ask me again on my last night? - Your last night? - Yes. Try me on the last night. See what happens then, shall we? It's exciting. Right. No, it's a perfect plan. That's absolutely perfect. Last night. Last night. Thanks very much. Night-night, Timmy. Big lesson number one, all the time travel in the world can't make someone love you. Bye! So the love of my life just drove away. And the very next day it was my turn to leave. There you go. Don't spend it all at once. Thanks. Don't call too often, your mother doesn't like to be disturbed. Okay. Thanks. I caught the train to London in search of a future and a girlfriend. I was staying in St John's Wood, near Abbey Road, with a playwright friend of my dad's called Harry. It's always nice to have family connections when you're a new kid in town. What the fuck do you want? I'm James's son. Who? - James Lake. - What about him? He said you had a room. Go in there and wait. Quietly. I mean it, don't make a sound. Or I'll kill you."

More details about this wonderful first meeting? Okay, okay. It was, um, what... Joanna? Oh, June 17th. And Jo was having a little party. A living hell from which Rupert, thank God, rescued me. And where was this terrible party? My brothel of a flat. Which is where, though? That's the question, isn't it. What are you, a detective? No, sorry, I've just got a very visual imagination. I like to imagine stuff completely. 26 Courtfield Gardens, SW5. Around 8:30. Dress code, slutty. Will that do? Absolutely, yes. Although I am wondering when you got there, Rupert. Early, late?

Guy with important question. Are you on your knees? On his knees. Mmm. Were you so bored in the play you decided to ask me to marry you afterwards? Huh? Something like that. Yeah. Exactly that. In fact, will you marry me? Any thoughts on the answer? \"Yes?\" \"No?\" \"Get out of my life, loser.\" They're all possible. I think I'll go for \"yes.\" Thank you for asking me. And thank you for not going for one of those melodramatic proposals with lots of people around. I hate other people. Me, too. Yeah. I'm just gonna turn off the radio. Okay. Good idea. Thanks, guys. Sorry, she's a bit tired. But we really appreciate it. Can you go? Wow! That's so beautiful. I don't think we'll be staying in the same room, somehow. Oh, really? Oh, if they offer you tea, just say no. Hello. Mum, this is Mary. - Mary! - Hi. Good Lord, you're pretty. Oh, no, it's just I've got a lot of mascara and lipstick on.",

Thanks again for the play. Triumph. Where do you wanna go? Well, wherever you like really. I can't compete. You know, I'm starting to think we slightly wasted that summer holiday. If we could travel back in time, maybe I wouldn't have said no. I'm... I'm just staying round the corner. Can you walk me home? Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, of course, yeah. Well, here we are. Mmm. It's a lot nicer inside. I'm sure it is. Mmm-hmm. - So... - So... So... So, lovely to see you, Charlotte. What a night. Total joy, but I've gotta get back because there's something very important that I have to do. Right now. - Wake up. - Mmm... - Wake up. - What? Mary. Would you like to marry me? Shh. Don't be so selfish, I'm sleeping. It's bad. Right. That went very well. Wake up. What? Wake up. Come and have a chat. Why? I've got something important to ask you. Can't it wait till morning? Not really. But I'm so comfy. I was having the loveliest dream. What is it? Why is there music on? It's got something to do with what I want to ask you. Wait a minute. Romantic music.

No one can ever prepare you for what happens when you have a child. When you see the baby in your arms and you know that it's your job now. No one can prepare you for the love and the fear. Oh, she's lovely. You were such an ugly baby. More chimpanzee than child. I remember the first time I saw you, I thanked God we were in driving distance of London Zoo."

Yeah, it's fabulous. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. Great. Good. Um... How about the blue one? - The blue one? - Yeah. The first one that you tried on that was boring and lumpy, but that wasn't actually boring and lumpy, that one? Yeah, which do you prefer? I don't know. I'm actually starting to go mad. I think I like the blue one. - Okay. - Yeah. Okay. Okay, let's go with this one, then? You look amazing. - Really? - Yes. Okay, thanks. Oh, God. Where's Posy? I left her downstairs. Not leaving the door open to the room with the manuscript in it? I don't think so. - Look at me. Look me in the eye... - Mmm-hmm. ...and talk me through this. Basically my life is over. I really need to go out for just like two minutes, maybe one. Don't you dare! Don't you dare answer that! What am I gonna do? I think that we should really answer the phone.

Perhaps they became the restless people they were in consequence. Anyhow, Mr Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me...\" What do you think about the kids? What about them? Not many of them, are there? What? Well, I mean two? It's more than the Chinese are allowed. I just thought that maybe, you know, it was time for the insurance baby. What? In case one of them is really smart, we don't want the other one to feel stupid their whole life. And if we had a third one, then we could have two happy dummies. What do you think? Huh? It was the toughest decision of my life. Saying 'yes' to the future meant saying 'goodbye' to my dad. Forever. Why don't we wait a bit? Absolutely. You're right. Yeah. How about now? Or now? Now? Yeah, okay. Really? Dad always wished there had been more of us. So... Anyway, we might try and nothing happens. Exactly. Really could be tonight. Mmm. And you cannot believe the detail in which I know the route to the hospital. Oh, yay. Will you excuse me for a sec? Just have to go downstairs. Mmm. ...and it's 17-20 in this incredibly tight contest being played by the two most physically perfect players in the history of the game. The crowd, enchanted by the younger player, are seduced by memories of the older player's illustrious past. Ahh! Oh, my God, I've won. I haven't won in years. You finally got good. What's my prize? Apart from the Olympic gold medal, of course. A kiss will have to do. A kiss? A kiss? Oh. Ah, I get you. This is it, then? This is it. It's my last bit of extra time. The baby is completely on the way. Oh! Congratulations. My son. My dad. Is there anything at all I can do? Is there anything you want to do? I don't know. There is this one thing. A quick little walk. Totally against the rules, of course, but if we don't change a thing, if we're very careful, it shouldn't do any harm. It would be nice. I'm really trying. I'm really trying. Get down low. Total defeat. I'm tired. Thanks, Dad. So I'm almost up-to-date with my story.",

Can I just read you this one bit? Read away, I've got lots of time. \"I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much with their noses. Perhaps they became the restless people they were in consequence. Anyhow, Mr Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me...\" What do you think about the kids? What about them? Not many of them, are there?
