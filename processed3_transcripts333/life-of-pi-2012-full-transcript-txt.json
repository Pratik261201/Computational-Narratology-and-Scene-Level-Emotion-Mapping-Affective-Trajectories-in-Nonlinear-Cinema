      "raw_text": "(TAMIL SONG PLAYING) (SQUAWKING) WRITER: So you were raised in a zoo? PI: Born and raised. In Pondicherry, in what was the French part of lndia. My father owned the zoo... and I was delivered on short notice by a herpetologist... who was there to check on the Bengal monitor lizard. Mother and I were both healthy... but the poor lizard escaped... and was trampled by a frightened cassowary. The way of karma, huh? The way of God. That's quite a story. I had assumed your father was a mathematician because of your name. Far from it, I was named after a swimming pool. There is a swimming pool named \"Pi\"? (CHUCKLES) You see, my uncle Francis was born with too much water in his lungs. They say the doctors swung Francis around by the ankles to clear the water out... and that's what gave him the huge chest and skinny legs... that made him such a great swimmer. Is Francis actually your uncle? He said he was friends with your father. He's my honorary uncle, I call him Mamaji. My father's best friend, my swimming guru. PI: I trained with him three times a week at the ashram. His lessons would save my life in the end. (COUGHING) A mouthful of water will not harm you, but panic will. Remember to breathe now, don't hold your breath. Good boy. I hope you don't mind vegetarian. No, no. Not at all. And your name? Huh? You were going to tell me how you got your name, I think. Oh, yes. I got it from something Mamaji once told my father. You see, most travelers collect postcards or teacups on their journeys... but not Mamaji. Mamaji collects swimming pools. He swims in every pool he comes upon. One day, Mamaji said to my father that, of all the pools in the world... the most beautiful was a public pool in Paris. That the water there was so clear, you could make your morning coffee with it. That a single swim there changed his life. Before I was born, he said... \"If you want your son to have a clean soul...\" \"you must take him one day to swim in the Piscine Molitor.\" I never understood why my father took this so much to heart. But he did, and I was named \"Piscine Molitor Patel.\" Imagine me trying to explain that name. I barely made it to the age of 11 before... BOY: Hey, Piscine! Are you pissing right now? (ALL LAUGHING) Look at him, he's pissing!",

Pi, the sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet... which is also used in mathematics to represent the ratio... of any circle's circumference to its diameter.

Oh, I don't even know how to sail. And I wasn't alone out there. Richard Parker was with me. Richard Parker? Mamaji didn't tell me everything. He just said I should look you up when I got back to Montreal. So, what were you doing in Pondicherry? Writing a novel. By the way, I enjoyed your first book. So, this new one, is it set in India? No, Portugal, actually. But it's cheaper living in India. Ah, well, I look forward to reading it. You can't. I threw it out. Two years trying to bring this thing to life... and then one day, it sputtered, coughed and died. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, I was sitting in this coffee house in Pondicherry one afternoon, mourning my loss... when this old man at the table next to me struck up a conversation. Yeah, Mamaji, he does that. When I told him about my abandoned book, he said...

As for God, I can only tell you my story. You will decide for yourself what you believe. Fair enough. Let's see, then. Where to begin? Pondicherry is the French Riviera of India. In the streets closest to the ocean, you might think you were in the south of France. A few blocks inland, there's a canal. Just beyond that is Indian Pondicherry. And the Muslim quarter is just to the west. When the French handed Pondicherry back to us in 1954... the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order. My father, who was a clever businessman, came up with one. He ran a hotel, and he got the idea to open a zoo... in the local botanical gardens instead. (SPEAKING IN TAMIL) PI: As it also happened, my mother was a botanist in the gardens. They met, married, and a year later my brother Ravi was born. I came two years after that. It sounds magical, growing up in... Amen. Yeah, let's eat. I didn't know Hindus said \"amen.\" Catholic Hindus do. Catholic Hindus? We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods, instead of just one. (CHUCKLES) But you're a Hindu first? None of us knows God until someone introduces us. I was first introduced to God as a Hindu. There are 33 million gods in the Hindu religion. How can I not come to know a few of them? I met Krishna first. (GITA SPEAKING IN TAMIL) Yashoda once accused baby Krishna of eating dirt. \"Tut, tut you naughty boy - you shouldn't do that.\" But he didn't! That's what he told her. \"I didn't eat dirt.\" Yashoda said, \"No? Well then...\" \"Open your mouth.\" So Krishna opened his mouth. And what do you think Yashoda saw? What? She saw in Krishna's mouth the whole entire universe. PI: The gods were my superheroes growing up. Hanuman, the monkey god... Lifting an entire mountain to save his friend Lakshman. Ganesh, the elephant-headed... risking his life to defend the honor of his mother, Parvati. Vishnu, the supreme soul, the source of all things. Vishnu sleeps, floating on the shoreless cosmic ocean... and we are the stuff of his dreaming. SANTOSH: Spectacle. Don't let these stories and pretty lights fool you, boys. Religion is darkness. PI: My dear appa believed himself part of the new India.",

Why would He send his own son... to suffer for the sins of ordinary people? Because He loves us. God made Himself approachable to us, human, so we could understand Him. We can't understand God in all His perfection. But we can understand God's son and His suffering as we would a brother's. That made no sense. Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty... What kind of love is that? But this son... I couldn't get him out of my head. YOU NG PI: If God is so perfect and we are not... why would He want to create all this? Why does He need us at all? All you have to know is that He loves us. God so loved this world that He gave His only son. PI: The longer I listened to the priest... the more I came to like this son of God. Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ. I came to faith through Hinduism and I found God's love through Christ. But God wasn't finished with me yet. (MUEZZIN CALLING) PI: God works in mysterious ways. And so it was, He introduced Himself again. This time by the name of Allah. (MUEZZIN CALLING) Allahu Akbar. PI: My Arabic was never very good... but the sound and feel of the words brought me closer to God. In performing Salah... the ground I touched became holy ground... and I found a feeling of serenity and brotherhood. This lamb is exquisite. It's the best dish on the table. You're all missing out. You only need to convert to three more religions, Piscine... and you will spend your life on holiday. (RAVI LAUGHING) Are you going to Mecca this year, Swami Jesus? Or to Rome for your coronation as Pope Pi-us?",

Why would He send his own son... to suffer for the sins of ordinary people? Because He loves us. God made Himself approachable to us, human, so we could understand Him. We can't understand God in all His perfection. But we can understand God's son and His suffering as we would a brother's. That made no sense. Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty... What kind of love is that? But this son... I couldn't get him out of my head. YOU NG PI: If God is so perfect and we are not... why would He want to create all this? Why does He need us at all? All you have to know is that He loves us. God so loved this world that He gave His only son. PI: The longer I listened to the priest... the more I came to like this son of God. Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ. I came to faith through Hinduism and I found God's love through Christ. But God wasn't finished with me yet.  PI: God works in mysterious ways. And so it was, He introduced Himself again. This time by the name of Allah.  Allahu Akbar. PI: My Arabic was never very good... but the sound and feel of the words brought me closer to God. In performing Salah... the ground I touched became holy ground... and I found a feeling of serenity and brotherhood. This lamb is exquisite. It's the best dish on the table. You're all missing out. You only need to convert to three more religions, Piscine... and you will spend your life on holiday.  Are you going to Mecca this year, Swami Jesus? Or to Rome for your coronation as Pope Pi-us?"

I can't risk my life every time I have to climb onto the boat for supplies. It's time to settle this. If we're going to live together, we have to learn to communicate. Maybe Richard Parker can't be tamed, but with God's will, he can be trained.   No!  Good.  Go, Richard Parker. Go. Go on home, I'll leave you alone. I'll respect that, I promise. Go. Come on.  Yes! I never thought a small piece of shade could bring me so much happiness. That a pile of tools, a bucket, a knife, a pencil... might become my greatest treasures. Or that knowing Richard Parker was here might ever bring me peace. In times like these... I remember that he has as little experience with the real world as I do. We were both raised in a zoo by the same master. Now we've been orphaned, left to face our ultimate master together. Without Richard Parker, I would have died by now. My fear of him keeps me alert. Tending to his needs gives my life purpose. Dolphins. Hey, Richard Parker! Hey!  Above all, don't lose hope. Eight, five, five, zero, three, six, six... zero, eight, zero, one... three, six, zero, four, six, six, eight... What are you looking at? Talk to me. Tell me what you see. Words are all I have left to hang on to. Everything mixed up. Fragmented. Can't tell daydreams, night dreams, from reality anymo......  Storm, Richard Parker.  No!  No! Praise be to God! Lord of all worlds! The compassionate, the merciful! Ah! Come out. Richard Parker! Come out, you have to see this! It's beautiful!  Don't hide yourself! He's come to us! It's a miracle! Come out and see God, Richard Parker! Why are you scaring him? Oh, God! I've lost my family! I've lost everything! I surrender! What more do you want?  I'm sorry, Richard Parker.  We're dying, Richard Parker. I'm sorry. Amma, Appa, Ravi... I'm happy I'm going to see you soon. Can you feel the rain?  God, thank you for giving me my life."

He died. The morning after, the cook caught his first dorado... and I didn't understand what he had done at first, but Mother did... and I had never seen Mother so angry. \"Stop whining and be happy,\" he said. \"We need more food or we'll die. That was the whole point.\" \"What was the whole point?\" Mother asked. \"You let that poor boy die in order to get bait, you monster!\" The cook got furious. He started towards her with his fist raised... and Mother slapped him hard, right across the face. I was stunned. I thought he was going to kill her right then. But he didn't. The cook didn't stop at bait either, no. The sailor... He went the same way the rat went. The cook was a resourceful man. It was a week later that he... Because of me. Because I couldn't hold on to a stupid turtle. It slipped out of my hands and swam away. And the cook came up and he punched me on the side of my head... and my teeth clacked and I saw stars. I thought he was going to hit me again... but Mother started pounding on him with her fists... She yelled at me to go to the raft. (SPEAKING TAMIL) I thought she was coming with me, or I'd never have... I don't know why I didn't make her go first. I think about that every day. I jumped over and turned back just as the knife came out. There wasn't anything I could do. I couldn't look away. He threw her body overboard. And then the sharks came. And I saw what they... I saw. The next day, I killed him. He didn't even fight back. He knew he had gone too far... even by his own standards. He'd left the knife out on the bench, and I did to him what he did to the sailor. He was such an evil man, but worse still, he... He brought the evil out in me. And I have to live with that. I was alone in a lifeboat... drifting across the Pacific Ocean. And I survived. PI: After that, they had no more questions. The investigators didn't seem to like the story, exactly. But they thanked me, they wished me well, and they left. So the stories... both the zebra and the sailor... broke their leg. And the hyena killed the zebra and the orangutan. So... the hyena is the cook.",
