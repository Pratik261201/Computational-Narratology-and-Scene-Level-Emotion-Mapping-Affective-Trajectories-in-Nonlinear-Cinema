      "raw_text": "Shit! Andrew, hey. Here you go. Your regular lattes. Literally saved my life. Thank you. Thank you. - Everyone OK? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Me too. Hello, Frank? How's my favorite writer? Of course you've been thinking about our talk because you know I'm right. Frank, people in this country are busy, broke, and they hate to read. They need someone they can trust to say, \"Hey! Don't watch CSl: Indianapolis tonight. Read a book! Read Frank's book. \" And that person is Oprah. - Cuttin' it close. - One of those mornings. Thank you, Captain Obvious. Sweet... - Uh, sorry. ... Jesus! Rub some dirt on it, brother. Frank, the truth is all A- plus novelists do publicity. Roth, McCourt, Russo, and... Frank! Can I tell you what else they have in common? A Pulitzer. I need the shirt off your back. Literally. - You're kidding, right? - Yankees, Boston, this Tuesday, two company seats for your shirt. You have five seconds to decide. Five, four, three, two, one. I know... - Shh! - Later. Uh-oh. Uh, hello. Hello? Morning, boss. You have a conference call in 30 minutes. Yes. About the marketing of the spring books. I know. Staff meeting at 9:00. Did you call, um... What's her name? The one with the ugly hands. - Janet. - Yes, Janet. Yes. I did call her. I told her that if she doesn't get her manuscript in on time you won't give her a release date. Your immigration lawyer called. He said it's imperative... Cancel the call, push the meeting to tomorrow and keep the lawyer on the sheets. Oh, and get a hold of PR, have them start drafting a press release. Frank is doing Oprah. Wow. Nicely done. If I want your praise, I will ask for it. Um... Who is, uh, who is Jillian? And why does she want me to call her? Well, that was originally my cup. And I'm drinking your coffee why? Because your coffee spilled. So, you drink unsweetened cinnamon light soy lattes? I do. It's like Christmas in a cup. Is that a coincidence? Incredibly, it is. I mean I wouldn't possibly drink the same coffee that you drink just in case yours spilled. That would be pathetic. Morning. Miss Tate's office. Hey, Bob. Actually, we're headed to your office right now. Yeah. Why are we headed to Bob's office? Oop! Have you finished the manuscript I gave you? Uh, I read a few pages. I wasn't that impressed. - Can I say something?",

Now remember, you're just a prop in here. Won't say a word. Ah! Our fearless leader and her liege. Please, do come in. Oh. Beautiful breakfront. Is it new? It is English Regency Egyptian Revival, built in the 1800s but, yes, it is new to my office. Witty. Bob, I'm letting you go. Pardon? I asked you over a dozen times to get Frank to do Oprah, and you didn't do it. You're fired. I have told you that is impossible. Frank hasn't done an interview in 20 years. Well that is interesting, because I just got off the phone with him, and he is in. Excuse me? You didn't even call him, did you? - But... - I know, I know. Frank can be a little scary to deal with. For you. Now, I will give you two months to find another job. And then you can tell everyone you resigned, OK? What's his twenty? He's moving. He has crazy eyes. Don't do it, Bob. Don't do it. You poisonous bitch! You can't fire me! You don't think I see what you're doing here? Sandbagging me on this Oprah thing just so that you can look good to the board? Because you are threatened by me! - And you are a monster. - Bob, stop. Just because you have no semblance of a life outside of this office, you think that you can treat all of us like your own personal slaves. You know what? I feel sorry for you. Because you know what you're gonna have on your deathbed? Nothing and no one. Listen carefully, Bob. I didn't fire you because I feel threatened. No. I fired you because you're lazy, entitled, incompetent and you spend more time cheating on your wife than you do in your office. And if you say another word, Andrew here is gonna have you thrown out on your ass, OK? Another word and you're going out of here with an armed escort. Andrew will film it with his little camera phone and he will put it on that Internet site. - What was it? - YouTube? Exactly. Is that what you want? Didn't think so. I have work to do.

It's not like I'm even an immigrant! I'm from Canada, for Christ's sake. There's gotta be... there's gotta be something we can do. We can reapply, but unfortunately you have to leave the country for at least a year. OK. OK, well, that's not ideal, but, uh... I can, uh... I can manage everything from Toronto...

Excuse me, we're in a meeting. - Sorry to interrupt. - What? What! Mary from Miss Winfrey's office called. She's on the line. - I know. - She's on hold. She needs to speak with you right away. I told her you were otherwise engaged. She insisted, so... sorry. So... Uh... Come here. Uh... Gentlemen, I understand. I understand... the predicament that we are in. And, um... And there's, uh... well... I think there's something that you should know. Uh... we're, uh... we're getting married. We are getting married. - Who is getting married? - You and I. You and I are getting married! Yes. - We are. - Getting married. - We are getting married. - Yes. Isn't he your secretary? Assistant. Executive, uh... assistant secretary. Titles. But, wouldn't be the first time one of us fell for our secretaries. Would it, Edwin? With Laquisha. Remember? So, yeah... The truth is, you know, Andrew and I, we're... we are just two people who weren't meant to fall in love but we did. No. All those late nights at the office and weekend book fairs. - Yeah... - No. - Something happened. - Something. Yeah. Tried to fight it and... Can't, can't fight a... Can't fight a love like ours, so, uh... Uh... Are we good with this? Are you happy? Because, well... we are happy. So happy. - Margaret. - Yes? It's terrific. Just make it legal. Mmm? Oh! Legal. Yeah, well, then... then that means we... ...we need to get ourselves to the immigration office. So we can work this whole mess out. Right? Thank you very much, gentlemen. We will do that right away. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Thank you. - Gentlemen. - Thank you. Margaret and Andrew are getting married! What is that about? Dragon Lady! Here they come... Yeah. What is he thinking? Mmm-mmm-mmm. Dude, for real. Her? Married? Didn't even know they were dating... What? I don't understand what's happening. Relax. This is for you, too. Do explain. They were going to make Bob chief. So naturally I would have to marry you."

Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts. We are beginning our descent into Juneau. Juneau? I thought we were going to Sitka. - We are. - How are we getting to Sitka? Whoa. All right.

Where's Dad? Oh, you know your father. He's always working. Never mind about him. Where's your girl? Uh, she's... right there. - Ah. - There she is. I guess the word \"girl\" is inappropriate.

You didn't tell me about all the family businesses, honey. He was probably just being modest, dear. Oh. What are we doing? Shouldn't we check into our hotel right now? Oh, we canceled your reservation. Family doesn't stay at a hotel. You're gonna stay in our home. Oh, great! Great. - What? - God. You're gonna wanna use your legs to lift that one. Andrew! Help her with those. I'd love to, but she won't let me do anything. She insists on doing it all herself. She's one of those... she's a feminist. Come on, sweetie. You see the shoes that broad was wearing? This is the last of 'em. - Oh! - Ooh. - Five second rule. - Got it! That will dry right off. Psst! Psst! I'm not getting on that boat. You don't have to.

The decoupage box that he made where he'd taken the time to cut out tiny, little pictures of himself. Yes. Just pasted all over the box. Oh! So beautiful. So I opened that beautiful, little decoupage and out fluttered these tiny, little hand-cut heart confettis.

No. But inside that box... ...underneath all that crap... ...there was a little handwritten note... with the address to a hotel, date, and time. Real Humphrey Bogart-type stuff. Yeah. Masculine. Anyway, naturally, Margaret thought... I thought he was seeing someone else. It was a terrible time for me, but I went to that hotel anyway.

Your son. Your son. And he was choking back soft, soft sobs. And when he held back the tears and finally caught his breath, he said to me... \"Margaret, will you marry me?\" And she said, \"Yep. \" The end. Who's hungry? That is quite a story. - Oh, Andy! - Gorgeous. You are so sensitive. Hand-cut confetti? Hey! Let's see a kiss from you two cuties. Give her a kiss! - No. Come on. - Oh, yeah. Come on! OK, all right. OK. Here we go. Ready? What is this? Kiss her on the mouth like you mean it. - Kiss her. Kiss her! - Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! OK! - OK. All right. - OK. - Here we go. - Mmm-hmm. OK. Oh! Andy! Give her a real kiss! - Gammy. - A real one! - Yeah. - You can do it! Why don't we just do it? Let's just do it really fast. Mmmm. - Mmm. - Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. - OK. - Mmm. Hmm. I'm so happy for you two! So happy! So happy! Let's get the champagne! So here we are. This is your bedroom. Wow. Wow, this is, um... beautiful.

You understand? If that's what makes you happy, son, I got nothing to say. Well, that's a first. You know what? Apology not accepted. Have fun out here. There is no way you could leave her at home. She had to be here. Absolutely. She's been coming here forever. I hope you are ready for your big surprise... ...because this is one of Sitka's greatest treasures. - Right? - Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

Apparently, I wasn't the most gracious of hosts last night. It was a little bit of a shock to find out that you're getting married... ...especially when none of us even knew you were dating. The point is... I owe you an apology. Accepted. There's something else. I've been going over my retirement plans recently, and it got me thinking. I've done a lot of things in my life. Practically built an empire with your mother from the ground up. It doesn't mean anything unless... Unless you have someone to leave it to. - We already discussed this. - I'd like to discuss it again. You have responsibilities here.

I think Brian Dennehy is sexy. Don't like flowers in the house, 'cause they remind me of funerals. Never played a video game. I read Wuthering Heights every Christmas. It's my favorite book. Haven't slept with a man in over a year and a half. And, uh... I went to the bathroom and cried after Bob called me a poisonous bitch. And the, uh, bird tattoo? They're swallows. Got them when I was 16... after my parents died. Stupid. I'm sure there's many many other things, but that's all I can come up with right now. You, uh, there? I'm here. Just processing. You really haven't slept with anyone in 18 months? Oh, my God. Out of all that, that's all you got? That's a long time. Yeah, well, I've been a little busy. Yeah... Who's, uh... - Rob Base and D. J... - E-Z Rock? - Yeah. - You know. - No. They were good. - Mm-mm. - What? - Nothing. I know who they are. I just wanted to hear you sing it. - Margaret? - Yes? Don't take this the wrong way. 'K. You are a very... very beautiful woman. - Feel it deep, feel it low. - Mmm-hmm. God, I can't sing that high. Huh? Where am I? What time is it? What time is it? Ooh! Ooh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh... Oh, God. Room service. Breakfast for the happy couple. Andrew! Andrew! Andr... Your mother's at the door. Get up! - Get up here! Your mother's... - Oh, God. Just a second! - Not the baby blanket. - OK, all right. Not the baby blanket. Get it off, get it off, get it off. - OK, all right. - Wait a second. Hold on. - What? What? - Are you wearing makeup? What? No. Of course not. - OK, what do we do? All right. - Just spoon me, spoon me... - Oh, my God! What is that? - I'm sorry. It's morning. What do you mean, \"It's morning\"? Are you OK? Yep! Coming. One second. Yep. Come on in. Everything's fine. Disgusting. Ow, you're on my hair. OK, just... - Oh, wow. - Ooh, smells good. Cinnamon rolls. Oh, you shouldn't have gone to that trouble. Oh, you're family now. It's no trouble. Hey, you have room for one more? Wow. Could we not do the Brady family meeting right now?"

And for three years I watched him work harder than anyone else at our company. And I knew that if I threatened to destroy his career... ...he would, he would do just about anything. So I blackmailed him to come up here and to lie to you. All of you. And I thought it would be easy to watch him do it. But it wasn't. Turns out it's not easy to ruin someone's life once you find out how wonderful they are. You have a beautiful family. Don't let this come between you. This was my fault. Margaret... Andrew, this was a business deal, and you held up your end, but now the deal is off. I'm sorry. And, you, meet me at the dock. You're giving me a ride to the airport. - What were you thinking? - I don't, I don't know. Andrew, you lied to us. Let me get my head on straight, OK? I'll explain everything later. I'm sorry. You were right. This book is special. I lied because I knew publishing meant I'd lose you as an assistant but... you have an extraordinary eye, and I'll make sure we buy this before I leave. Have an amazing life. You deserve it. Margaret. Well, that was, uh... crazy. You know, people are gonna be talking about this forever. Yeah. Yeah. Are you OK? Yeah. No. Uh... I just feel... You know what the problem is? The problem is that this woman... ...is a gigantic pain in my ass. First there's the whole leaving thing. I understand that. It's a sham wedding. It's kind of stressful. But then she goes ahead and she leaves this note. Because she doesn't have the decency... the humanity to do it to my face. Three years. Three years I work with this... this terrorist. Never once has she had a nice thing to say, and then she goes ahead and she writes this crap! - Andrew. - But none of that matters because we had a deal! - Andrew. - Sorry. I'm sorry. I just... She just makes me a little crazy. Yeah. I can see that. So you're just gonna let her go? So, what now? Well... now that you're leaving voluntarily, it all becomes very civilized. Once we land in New York, you have 24 hours to head back to Canada. - Andrew, what's happening? - I got to talk to her. - Why would you do that? - Boys! This has nothing to do with you. Boys, stop it! Stop it!",
