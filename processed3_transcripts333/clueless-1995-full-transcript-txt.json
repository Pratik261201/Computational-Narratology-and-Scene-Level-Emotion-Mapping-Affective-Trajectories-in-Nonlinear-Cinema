I get up, I brush my teeth, and I pick out my school clothes. (POP MUSlC PLAYlNG) CHER: Daddy's a litigator. Those are the scariest kinds of lawyers. -Even Lucy, our maid, is terrified of him. -(LUCY EXCLAlMlNG FRANTlCALLY) And Daddy's so good, he gets $500 an hour to fight with people. He fights with me for free because I'm his daughter. -Daddy. -Cher, please don't start -with the juice again. -Daddy, you need your vitamin C. Where's my briefcase? lt's been a couple of months now, so l said we'd go out to Malibu. Don't tell me those brain-dead lowlifes have been calling again. They are your parents. And don't try sneaking out of the office. Dr. Lovett's coming by to give you a flu shot. Josh is in town, he's coming for dinner. -Why? -He's your stepbrother. You were hardly even married to his mother and that was five years ago. -Why do l have to see Josh? -You divorce wives, not children. -Here. -Forget it! CHER: Did l showyou the loqued-out jeep Daddy got me? It's got four-wheel drive, dual side airbags, and a monster sound system. I don't have a license yet, but I needed something to learn on. Boy, they came out of nowhere. Here's where Dionne lives. She's my friend because we both know what it's like to have people be jealous of us. Dude! Girlfriend! CHER: And I must give her snaps for her courageous fashion efforts. Hey, Cher. CHER: Dionne and l were both named after great singers of the past who now do infomercials. So? Go shopping with Dr. Seuss? At least l wouldn't skin a collie to make my backpack. CHER: lt's faux. -Hello! That was a stop sign. -l totally paused. Yeah. Okay. DlONNE: lt's not even 8:30 and Murray is paging me. -He is so possessive. -Tell me about it. This weekend he called me and he's all, \"Where were you?\" l'm like, \"l'm at my grandmother's...\" CHER: Dionne and her boyfriend Murray are in this dramatic relationship. I think they've seen that Ike and Tina Turner movie just too many times. Now I have to say to her... De, why do you put up with it? You could do so much better. l know. Shh. Here he comes.

No, but speaking of vehicular sex perhaps you can explain how this cheap K-Mart hair extension -got into the back seat of your car. -l don't know where that came from. That looks like one of your little stringy things you got up in your hair. l do not wear polyester hair, okay?

Should all oppressed people be allowed refuge in America? Amber will take the con position. Cher will be pro. Cher, two minutes. So, okay. Like right now, for example, the Haitians need to come to America. But some people are all, \"What about the strain on our resources?\" But it's like, when l had this garden party for my father's birthday, right? l said RSVP because it was a sit-down dinner. But people came that, like, did not RSVP. So, l was like totally bugging. l had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish in extra place settings, but by the end of the day it was, like, the more the merrier. And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion, may l please remind you that it does not say \"RSVP\" on the Statue of Liberty. Thank you very much. (SHRlEKS EXClTEDLY) Amber, a reply? Mr. Hall, how can l answer that? The topic is Haiti and she's talking about some little party. Hello! lt was his 50th birthday. Whatever. lf she doesn't do the assignment, l can't do mine. Ladies. So, does anyone have any further thoughts on Cher's oration? Elton, comments? Yeah, l can't find my Cranberries CD. l gotta go to the Quad -before somebody snags it. -l'm afraid l can't permit that. -Any further insights? -l had an insight, Mr. Hall. l'm all ears. Okay. Like, the way l feel about the Rolling Stones is the way my kids are gonna feel about Nine lnch Nails, so l really shouldn't torment my mum anymore, huh?",

You look taller than you did at Easter. l don't think so. -Doesn't he look bigger? -His head does. Josh, have you given any thought to our little discussion about corporate law? Yeah, but l think l'd really like to check out environmental law. What for? You want to have a miserable, frustrating life? Josh will have that no matter what he does. At least he knows what he wants to do and he's in a good college. l'd like to see you have a little bit of direction. -l have direction. -Yeah. Towards the mall. MEL: Which reminds me, where's your report card? -lt's not ready yet. -What do you mean, it's not ready yet? Well, some teachers were trying to lowball me, Daddy. And l know how you say never accept a first offer, so l figure these grades are just a jumping off point to start negotiations. Very good. -(PHONE RlNGlNG) -Whose is that? De? Hello? Yeah, Jake, what? No, not the afternoon! You are such a brownnoser. And you are such a superficial space cadet. What makes you think you'll get teachers to change your grades? Only the fact that l've done it every other semester. CHER: I told my P.E. teacher an evil male had broken my heart, so she raised my C to a B. -Miserable. -They're horrible. -l can't eat, l can't sleep. -Don't feel bad. l know. And you see, they're all like that. CHER: Then I promised Miss Geist I'd start a letter-writing campaign to my congressman about violations of the Clean Air Act. But Mr. Hall was totally rigid. He said my debates were unresearched, unstructured, and unconvincing. As if! I felt impotent and out of control, which I really hate. I needed to find sanctuary in a place where I could gather my thoughts and regain my strength. (SWEEPlNG lNSTRUMENTAL MUSlC) Dude, what's wrong? Are you suffering from buyer's remorse or something? God, no, nothing like that. lt's just that we've been shopping all day and l still don't know what to do about Mr. Hall. l tried everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude but l was brutally rebuffed.",

Thank you, Josh. l so need lessons from you on how to be cool. Tell me that part about Kenny G again. MEL: Come on, you chuckleheads, get in here. Josh, are you still growing? You look taller than you did at Easter. l don't think so. -Doesn't he look bigger? -His head does. Josh, have you given any thought to our little discussion about corporate law? Yeah, but l think l'd really like to check out environmental law. What for? You want to have a miserable, frustrating life? Josh will have that no matter what he does. At least he knows what he wants to do and he's in a good college. l'd like to see you have a little bit of direction. -l have direction. -Yeah. Towards the mall. MEL: Which reminds me, where's your report card? -lt's not ready yet. -What do you mean, it's not ready yet? Well, some teachers were trying to lowball me, Daddy. And l know how you say never accept a first offer, so l figure these grades are just a jumping off point to start negotiations. Very good. - -Whose is that? De? Hello? Yeah, Jake, what? No, not the afternoon! You are such a brownnoser. And you are such a superficial space cadet. What makes you think you'll get teachers to change your grades? Only the fact that l've done it every other semester. CHER: I told my P.E. teacher an evil male had broken my heart, so she raised my C to a B. -Miserable. -They're horrible. -l can't eat, l can't sleep. -Don't feel bad. l know. And you see, they're all like that. CHER: Then I promised Miss Geist I'd start a letter-writing campaign to my congressman about violations of the Clean Air Act. But Mr. Hall was totally rigid. He said my debates were unresearched, unstructured, and unconvincing. As if! I felt impotent and out of control, which I really hate. I needed to find sanctuary in a place where I could gather my thoughts and regain my strength.  Dude, what's wrong? Are you suffering from buyer's remorse or something? God, no, nothing like that. lt's just that we've been shopping all day and l still don't know what to do about Mr. Hall. l tried everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude but l was brutally rebuffed."

Oh, my God, do you see how he's falling in love with me? Excuse me. l mean, look how he ignores every other girl. What's it all about? What am l gonna do with that? l wouldn't know. Oh, God, look.

You've been very dedicated to this case. Yeah, it was a good learning experience, at least for me. l want to be a lawyer. But you, l mean, you don't need to be doing this. Go out and have fun. Go shopping. You think that's all l do?"
