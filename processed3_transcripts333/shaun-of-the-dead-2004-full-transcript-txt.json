Ed, it's not that I don't like you. It's all right. - It'd just be nice if we could... - Fuck. ...spend a bit more time together. - Bollocks. - Just the two of us. - Cock it. With Ed here, it's no wonder I always bring my flatmates out and that only exacerbates things. - What do you mean? - You guys hardly get on, do you? No, what does \"exacerbate\" mean? It means to make things worse. Right, right. Well, I mean, it's not that I don't like David and Di, you know. - Guys, it's not that I don't like you. - It's all right. And I do want to spend time with you. It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends. Can I get any of you cunts a drink? Anybody? No, thank you. I know... friends are important to Shaun but you must set some quality time aside for yourselves. Daffs is always taking me to see these listed buildings and I'm always dragging him to the theatre. - I'm not so hot on theatre. - How about a meal? - It's your anniversary soon. - It was last week. - Did you do anything special? - We came here. Shaun. Hog lumps. Shaun, what I'm trying to say is I need something more, more than spending every night in the Winchester. I want to do more interesting stuff. I want you to want to want to do it. Listen to me. I'm beginning to sound like your mum. - Not that I'd know. - You haven't met his mum? - Not yet. - Don't you get along with your mum? - It's not her... - Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun? - No, I love my mum. - I love his mum. Ed! - Shaun! - Liz. I understand what you're trying to say and I agree. We should get out there. We'll start tomorrow. I'll book a restaurant. The place that does all the fish. Just the two of us. Things will change. I promise. Really, Shaun? Time, gentlemen. Shaun? \"Player two has entered the game.\" Haven't you got work? \"Player two has left the game.\" The front door was open again last night. - I'm not saying it was you. - I know, man. - I'm saying it was Ed. - Right. I can't live like this. Look at the state of it. We're not students any more. - Pete... - He brings no money into the house. - He brings a bit. - What? Dealing drugs? He sells a bit of weed now and again.",

Where are we gonna go? - The Winchester. - Don't be stupid! They don't do food. - There's a Breville out back. - Ed, this is serious! Hello. - \"Hello, it's me.\" - Hello. \"What's the plan, then?\" Erm, there's been a bit of a... a mix-up with the table, babe. - \"What do you mean?\" - They're full up. \"But... I thought you said it was all OK?\" Yeah. \"You didn't book it, did you, Shaun?\" - No. - \"So... what is the plan, then?\" The Winchester? - \"Hello?\" - Dianne, can you let me in? - \"I'm not sure, Shaun.\" - Oh, come on. \"Lizzie doesn't want to see you.\" - Just open the door! - \"She doesn't want to see you.\" Do you want me to climb up the wall, come through the window? Because I will. \"You're not coming in.\" - OK, see you in a minute. - \"Don't...\" \"Hi, it's me again.\" Can we just talk about this?

And, hold it there. Ed! Just get her off me. Jesus! - What's up with her eyes? - Now, seriously... Mary, I'm warning you, I'll have to get physical, I mean it! This is it... Look, just fuck off! - I think we should go back inside. - OK. - Shaun, what's going on? - Shit, it's engaged. - How about an ambulance? - It's engaged, Ed. - Fire engine? - It's one number and it's busy! - And what do you want a fire engine for? - Anything with flashing lights. Are they still out there? Yeah. What do you think we should do? Have a sit-down? \"There are reports of chaos on the motorways \"as thousands of people attempt to flee the cities. \"The M1, the M3, M4, M6...\" - Do you think this is the same thing? - \"... are all at a standstill. \"The Home Office is urging people to stay in their homes and await further instruction.\" \"Ensure all residences are secure \"with all doors and windows firmly locked and barricaded. Police...\" - For God's sake! He's got an arm off! - Get him! \"More reports just in confirm that in all cases the attackers seem slow and shambolic...\" I'm gonna shut the front door. \"... regarding the best way to neutralise the attackers. \"In the meantime, contact with these assailants is highly inadvisable.\" - Did you see his head go? - \"If you're confronted...\" - We should get out there. - No, we should stay inside. - We can take 'em. - The man said to stay indoors. - Fuck the man. - In here, we're safe. \"... the attackers can be stopped by removing the head or destroying the brain. \"I'll repeat that, by removing the head or destroying the brain.\" Hey! Aim for the head. - Now what? - Get more stuff. - What's in the shed? - Dunno, it's locked. - Why is it locked? - It's always been locked. No!"

There comes a time when... you just... gotta be a man. I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing. Hello, Edward. - Hi, Barbara. - My, how you've grown. You better believe it. What happened? Why is he coming? - It wasn't as easy as all that. - Are we following you? No, it's probably best if we... Where's the car? Hmm... I pranged it. You were parked. Yeah. I guess we'll have to take the Jag. - Philip? - What? Look out! Christ! - Give me the car keys! - You're not driving that car. Give me the car keys! Ed, get Mum in the car. I'm on it.
