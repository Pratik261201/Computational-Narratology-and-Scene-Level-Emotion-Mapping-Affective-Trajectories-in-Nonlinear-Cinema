For I have been charged by my fellow geographers to leave the comforts of home and family and set off upon a voyage of discovery. I travel light, carrying only the absolute essentials. Maps, rations, modest timepiece and travel piano. (piano clangs) And finally, deep in the undergrowth, I spot something extraordinary. An undiscovered species of bear. Time to collect a specimen for the museum. (bear growls softly) I thought my time was up, my ticket was punched. But the bear saved my life. He guided me through the jungle to show me his world, and in return, I introduced him to ours. That's, erm... That's a telescope. That's my grandfather's telescope. Oh, be very careful with that. - That's soap. Really wouldn't eat that. - (bear chokes) Here we are, why don't you try this? This is marmalade. You spread it on toast, put it in sandwiches, or... Or you can drink it. Jolly good. This is London. That's where I'm from. Lon-don. Good Lord! Now try Stratford-upon-Avon. Over time, I become friends with the bears and even name them. The female after my dear departed mother and the male after an exotic boxer I once met in a bar. But the time eventually comes to return to my wife and daughter and share my findings with the world. Goodbye, Lucy. Goodbye, Pastuzo. And if you ever make it to London, you can be sure of a very warm welcome. I have learnt so much from these bears but I wonder what, if anything, they have learnt from me. (sniffs) (gasps) (young male) Marmalade! They're ripe. They're ripe. They're finally ripe! Aunt Lucy! Uncle Pastuzo! You're never going to guess... Whoa! Good morning, Aunt Lucy. Good morning, my little hurricane. Why do you have to come crashing in here like a natural disaster? But, Uncle Pastuzo... they're ripe. (gasps) (Pastuzo) Whoa-ho-ho! It's Marmalade Day! (young bear) Marmalade Day! Oh, it rather suits me. Marmalade Day! (chuckles) Oh, do calm down, you two. There's no need to rush. - (bell dings) - (gasps I laughs) Now be careful up there. And keep your paws off my hat. (young bear) I will. (Lucy) Marmalade. Just one sandwich contains all the vitamins and minerals a bear needs for a whole day.",

Embarrassing. But tasty. (laughs) (explorer) Friendly advice for the foreigner in London. Lesson three. It's dusk, and you pass a stranger in the street. - Greet them politely. - (both) Good evening.

Then, what will you do? Oh, don't you worry about me. I will be safe in the home for retired bears. But it is not yet time for you to retire. You must find a new home. In London. But... But I don't know anyone there. What if they don't even like bears? You know, there was once a war in the explorer's country. Thousands of children were sent away for safety, left at railway stations with labels around their necks, and unknown families took them in and loved them like their own.

Everyone's gone. He'll have to come with us. - No way. -  Dad! - Stay where you are. - He's so embarrassing.  We can't leave him here.  We can. He's not our responsibility.  He's a young bear who needs our help, Henry. It's just for one night, until we can find the right people to look after him.  There you are.  - OK. - Yes! -  Excuse me? Erm... -  Hello. I'm dreadfully sorry, I don't actually know your name. Well, I've got a bear name, but it seems to be rather hard to pronounce. That's not ripe. - Perhaps you'd like an English name. - An English name? Like what? Oh, look, Henry, it's perfect. You want to call him Ketchup? Ketchup the bear? - Paddington! - Paddington? Paddington. Pa-dding-ton. - Paddington! -  Sorry! I like it. Well, then, Paddington, how would you like to come home with us? ♪ London is the place for me ♪ London, that lovely city ♪ You could go to France or America ♪ India, Asia or Australia ♪ You're gonna come back to London City ♪ London is the place for me  Oh! What sort of route do you call that? Well, the young bear said it was his first time in London. I thought I'd show him the sights. - Should've charged morel - Keep the change.  Cheer up, mate. Might never happen.  Darling, have you got your keys?  Come on, Paddington.   Oh, yes.   But this... this is wonderful! Do you know, I was actually beginning to think nobody would give me a home, but this...l  That's ripe."

Did you say marmalade? - Hmm. - What happened to him? - He sneaked out in the mail van. - Yes? - I tracked him to Paddington. - Good. But then he disappeared. I'm sorry. It's just that that creature means a great deal to me. Why? Is he endangered? He is now. (yawns) (coos) (gasps) Oof! Now, I know you all like marmalade, but this is my sandwich. Erm, you're not using those ear brushes to clean your mouth, are you, Mr Brown? - Peculiar habit. - (groans / spits) Morning! Awesome. (Henry) Jonathan.

Something's jamming the system. I think it's a baguette. Is that peanut butter? Too orange. I think it's... Marmalade.   Hey, you!  Stop that sexy woman! Halt!  - You have a beautiful home, Mr Curry. - I've lived here all my life. I inherited it from my mother. A very distant woman. And being such a pillar of the community, I can see why having that beast move in next door would upset you so. I suppose I should be grateful that it's only one bear."

They were intelligent and civilised. Come off it, Clyde. They didn't even speak English. - Well, no, but... - Did they play cricket? - Drink tea? - Do the crossword?

(Paddington) Dear Aunt Lucy. I'm sorry I haven't written sooner but so much has been happening. I even met the explorer's daughter, but she tried to stuff me, so Mrs Bird threw her off a roof. Millicent Clyde... The judge didn't think that prison would do her any good. So instead, he gave her community service... No, please! Anything! Anything but that! ..In the petting zoo. - Get a move on, dung breath! - It's not my breath! (Screams) Back in Windsor Gardens, life is very different. Mrs Bird says it's because things are finally set fair and it's had a tremendous effect on her knees. Judy's embarrassment is clearing up and she's even let Mrs Brown meet Tony. - You can't say anything. - Of course not. - You can't touch me. - I won't touch anyone, darling. - And you're not gonna cry. - No! No. There's just a lot going on in my heart right now. We process things very differently, you and I. - I know. - Good. Mum, this is Tony. - Welcome to the family. - Oh. Mum! Sorry. Sorry. Not crying. Henry? I'm sorry about her. She's weird. Er, but we all are. Tea, anyone? No? No. (Paddington) And Mr Brown is helping Jonathan build an enormous rocket. Are you sure about this, Dad? If we're gonna get this bad boy into orbit, we're gonna need all the nitroglycerin. Although Jonathan worries about his father's reckless attitude to safety. Houston, we may have a problem. Duck! (explosion) (Paddington) Mrs Brown says that in London, everyone is different, but that means anyone can fit in.

        "- Judy. Now, has anyone seen... Ah, thank you, Mrs Bird. I think every home should have a marmalade day. -  And a bear. -  Especially a bear. Home.  Dear Aunt Lucy. I'm sorry I haven't written sooner but so much has been happening. I even met the explorer's daughter, but she tried to stuff me, so Mrs Bird threw her off a roof. Millicent Clyde... The judge didn't think that prison would do her any good. So instead, he gave her community service... No, please! Anything! Anything but that! ..In the petting zoo. - Get a move on, dung breath! - It's not my breath!  Back in Windsor Gardens, life is very different. Mrs Bird says it's because things are finally set fair and it's had a tremendous effect on her knees. Judy's embarrassment is clearing up and she's even let Mrs Brown meet Tony. - You can't say anything. - Of course not. - You can't touch me. - I won't touch anyone, darling. - And you're not gonna cry. - No! No. There's just a lot going on in my heart right now. We process things very differently, you and I. - I know. - Good. Mum, this is Tony. - Welcome to the family. - Oh. Mum! Sorry. Sorry. Not crying. Henry? I'm sorry about her. She's weird. Er, but we all are. Tea, anyone? No? No.  And Mr Brown is helping Jonathan build an enormous rocket. Are you sure about this, Dad? If we're gonna get this bad boy into orbit, we're gonna need all the nitroglycerin. Although Jonathan worries about his father's reckless attitude to safety. Houston, we may have a problem. Duck!   Mrs Brown says that in London, everyone is different, but that means anyone can fit in. I think she must be right, because although I don't look like anyone else, I really do feel at home. I will never be like other people, but that's alright. Because I am a bear. A bear called Paddington.
