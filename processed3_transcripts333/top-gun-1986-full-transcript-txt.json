Nine-hundred knots closure. -Cougar, you hear that? -Roger. -Merlin, you got him? -Roger, I've got radar contact. I'll get a visual ID. Cougar, you hook him. Roger, and I'll clean him and fry him. (GOOSE EXCLAIMING) COUGAR: Mustang. Mustang, this is Ghost Rider, 203. I've got him inbound, bogey heading 270. We're at ten miles, 900 knots closure. Ghost Rider, take Angels ten left, 30. Are we supposed to have visitors today? Negative, sir. -Merlin, see if he's a single. -Roger. -Goose, you see a trailer? -Negative, Merlin. Looks like he's a single. Cougar, I'm gonna go head-to-head with him. Take it easy, Maverick. I don't like this shit. I'm gonna break high and right, see if he's really alone. We've got 1,000 knots closure, Mav. He's coming right at us. Okay, buddy, what's on your mind? Holy shit, there's two of them. (GOOSE WHOOPING) GOOSE: MiG-28s. No one's been this close before. What the hell are they doing here? What's the position? Two hundred and fifty miles out, sir. Two hundred and fifty miles? Get them out of here. MAVERICK: Cougar, you've got MiG one. I'm going after MiG two. I lost him in the sun. Shit. What's he doing? You got him, Merlin? He's coming around. He's coming around on our tail. God damn it. This bogey's all over me. What's their range now? Two hundred miles, sir. If they break 150 miles, -launch the Alert Five aircraft. -Yes, sir. Air speed, 300. Go get him, Mav. I'm going for missile lock. Let's see if we can scare this guy out of here. Come on, lock up, baby. Lock up, baby. Lock up. I got him locked. Bingo. (LOCK ALERT BEEPING) We got him, Mav. He's bugging out and going home. Mustang, this is Maverick. MiG two is headed home. All right, what's their position? A hundred and eighty miles at bearing 010, sir. (MISSILE LOCK BEEPING) Cougar, he's got missile lock on us. Get away from this guy. What the hell is this shit?",

I should be a photographer. Cougar, your tail is clear. MiG one's bugged out. (COUGAR GASPING) Cougar, this is Maverick. We've had enough fun for one day, don't you think? I'm getting a little low on fuel, so we're heading home. (BREATHING HEAVILY) We'll see you on deck. Cougar, we're running low on gas, we gotta get out of here. (LOW FUEL BEEPING) Cougar.

Land immediately. Any of you boys seen an aircraft carrier around here? Mav, we got a little problem up here. That MiG really screwed him up. I don't think he can make it back.

I gotta do something here. I still can't believe it. I gotta give you your dream shot. I'm gonna send you up against the best. You two characters are going to Top Gun. For five weeks, you're gonna fly against the best fighter pilots in the world. You were number two, Cougar was number one. Cougar lost it, turned in his wings. You guys are number one.

      "raw_text": "During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-to-1. Our pilots become dependent upon missiles. They had lost some of their dogfighting skills. Now Top Gun was created to teach A.C.M. Air Combat Manoeuvring. Dogfighting. This gives me a hard-on. By the end of Vietnam, that ratio was back up to 12-to-1. Don't tease me. Blinds, please. Now I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our commanding officer at Top Gun. The very first man to win the Top Gun trophy. You will not find a finer fighter pilot anywhere in the world. Commander Mike Metcalf. Callsign, Viper. Gentlemen. You are the top one percent of all naval aviators. The elite. The best of the best. We'll make you better. You'll fly at least two combat missions a day, attend classes in between and evaluations of your performance. Now, on each combat sequence, you're gonna meet a different challenge. Every encounter is gonna be much more difficult. We're gonna teach you to fly the F-14 right to the edge of the envelope, faster than you've ever flown before and more dangerous. Now, we don't make policy here, gentlemen. Elected officials, civilians do that. We are the instruments of that policy. And although we're not at war, we must always act as though we are at war. What are you doing? -VIPER: The tip of the spear. . . -I'm just wondering. . . . . .best be sharp. . . .who's the best. In case some of you wonder who the best is, they're up here on this plaque on the wall. The best driver and his RIO from each class has his name on it.

        "During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-to-1. Our pilots become dependent upon missiles. They had lost some of their dogfighting skills. Now Top Gun was created to teach A.C.M. Air Combat Manoeuvring. Dogfighting. This gives me a hard-on. By the end of Vietnam, that ratio was back up to 12-to-1. Don't tease me. Blinds, please. Now I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our commanding officer at Top Gun. The very first man to win the Top Gun trophy. You will not find a finer fighter pilot anywhere in the world. Commander Mike Metcalf. Callsign, Viper. Gentlemen. You are the top one percent of all naval aviators. The elite. The best of the best. We'll make you better. You'll fly at least two combat missions a day, attend classes in between and evaluations of your performance. Now, on each combat sequence, you're gonna meet a different challenge. Every encounter is gonna be much more difficult. We're gonna teach you to fly the F-14 right to the edge of the envelope, faster than you've ever flown before and more dangerous. Now, we don't make policy here, gentlemen. Elected officials, civilians do that. We are the instruments of that policy. And although we're not at war, we must always act as though we are at war. What are you doing? -VIPER: The tip of the spear. . . -I'm just wondering. . . . . .best be sharp. . . .who's the best. In case some of you wonder who the best is, they're up here on this plaque on the wall. The best driver and his RIO from each class has his name on it. And they have the option to come back here to be Top Gun instructors. You think your name's gonna be on that plaque? Yes, sir. That's pretty arrogant, considering the company you're in. Yes, sir.

What were you doing there?  -Communicating. -Communicating. Keeping up foreign relations. I was, you know, giving him the bird. -You know, the finger. -Yes, I know the finger, Goose. I'm sorry, I hate it when it does that. I'm sorry.  Excuse me. So you're the one. Yes, ma'am. All right, gentlemen, we have a hop to take. The hard deck on this hop will be 10,000 feet. There'll be no engagement below that. JESTER: Move it! . . .disappear like that.  Lieutenant. Okay, well, don't be late again. -You look great, honey. -Thanks, dear. See you in preflight. Lieutenant, why didn't you tell me that you were a famous MiG insulter? -Would it have made any difference? -Not in the ladies' room, no. And what would've? I'm an instructor at this school. I see 20 new hotshots every eight weeks. Now, I'm sure you can figure that out."

Trying to prove something? Yeah, your old man did it right. What I'm about to tell you is classified. It could end my career. We were in the worst dogfight I ever dreamed of. Bogies like fireflies all over the sky. His F-4 was hit, he was wounded, but he could've made it back. He stayed in it, saved three planes before he bought it. How come I never heard that before? Now, that's not something the State Department tells dependents when the battle occurred over the wrong line on some map. So you were there? I was there. What's on your mind? My options, sir. Simple. First, you've acquired enough points to show up tomorrow and graduate with your Top Gun class. Or you can quit. There'd be no disgrace. That spin was hell. It would've shook me up. So you think I should quit? I didn't say that. The simple fact is, you feel responsible for Goose, and you have a confidence problem. Now, I'm not gonna sit here and blow sunshine up your ass, lieutenant. A good pilot is compelled to always evaluate what's happened. So he can apply what he's learned. Up there, we gotta push it. That's our job. It's your option, lieutenant, all yours. Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir, but thank you very much for your time. No problem. Good luck.

Well, hi, Maverick, come on in. -How are you doing? -Good. Really? You sure? You sure you're feeling -okay with everything? -Oh, I feel great. Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink -or anything else like that? -No, thank you. Okay, well, why don't you just. . . -Thank you very much. -. . .make yourself comfortable -because Mike will be right down, okay? -Great, thank you. I flew with your old man. VF-51, the Oriskany. You're a lot like he was. Only better and worse. He was a natural heroic son of a bitch, that one. So he did do it right. Yeah, he did it right. Is that why you fly the way you do? Trying to prove something? Yeah, your old man did it right. What I'm about to tell you is classified. It could end my career. We were in the worst dogfight I ever dreamed of. Bogies like fireflies all over the sky. His F-4 was hit, he was wounded, but he could've made it back. He stayed in it, saved three planes before he bought it. How come I never heard that before? Now, that's not something the State Department tells dependents when the battle occurred over the wrong line on some map. So you were there? I was there. What's on your mind? My options, sir. Simple. First, you've acquired enough points to show up tomorrow and graduate with your Top Gun class. Or you can quit. There'd be no disgrace. That spin was hell. It would've shook me up. So you think I should quit? I didn't say that. The simple fact is, you feel responsible for Goose, and you have a confidence problem. Now, I'm not gonna sit here and blow sunshine up your ass, lieutenant. A good pilot is compelled to always evaluate what's happened. So he can apply what he's learned. Up there, we gotta push it. That's our job. It's your option, lieutenant, all yours. Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir, but thank you very much for your time. No problem. Good luck.  GentIemen... -Where's Maverick? -...here at Top Gun, we challenged you to fly against the very best. I don't know where he is. Now, we ask you to take that expertise... You know what he's planning to do? ...and keep the tradition alive. Gotta be hard on the guy, though, you know?"
