Benefits of being section chief... ...I'd know if anyone had been promoted to double-0 status... ...wouldn't I? -Your file shows no kills, and it takes... -Two. Shame. We barely got to know each other. I know where you keep your gun. I suppose that's something. True. How did he die? Your contact? Not well. Made you feel it, did he? Well... ...you needn't worry. The second is... Yes. Considerably. So how do I trust this man that I've never met with my money? You asked for the introduction. That's all my organization will guarantee. I suppose our friend Mr. White will have told you... ...that I have provided reliable banking services... ...for many other freedom fighters over the years. Do you believe in God, Mr. Le Chiffre? No. I believe in a reasonable rate of return. I want no risk in the portfolio. Agreed. And I can access it anywhere in the world? Yes. I have the money, so short another million shares... ...of Skyfleet stock. Sir, you must know you're betting against the market. No one expects this stock to go anywhere but up. Just do it. Looks like our man. Burn scars on his face. I wonder if bomb-makers are insured for things like that. He's on the move. He's on the move, and he's heading straight for me. Stop touching your ear. -Sorry? -Put your hand down. Holster the bloody weapon, Carter. I need him alive. Weeping blood comes merely from a derangement of the tear duct... ...my dear general. Nothing sinister. All in. I have two pair, and you have a 17.4 percent chance... ...of making your straight. When does Ellipsis expire? -We have less than 36 hours. I can... -No. No, no. That's all the time I have anyway. Give our guests five minutes to leave... ...or throw them overboard. Who the hell do they think they are? I report to the prime minister, even he's smart enough... ...not to ask me what we do. Have you ever seen such a bunch of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs? They don't care what we do, they care what we get photographed doing. And how the hell could Bond be so stupid?",

Welcome to Miami International Airport. Curbside parking in front of the terminal is restricted.... -Yes. -It's Bond. I need her now. I'm afraid she can't be disturbed. Can I take a message? Listen, you go and find her, tell her to call Security at Miami Airport... ...because I think a bomb is about to go off. Do it now. -Sorry, can I put you on hold? -I thought you might. Bond? What the hell are you up to? I'll call you back. -The Skyfleet S570 prototype. -What about it? \"The largest airplane in the world will be unveiled today at Miami Airport.\" Oh, my God! Bond? Bond!

Why can't nice guys be more like you? Well, because then they'd be bad. Yes. But so much more interesting. What makes your husband a bad man? His nature, I suppose. The nature of his work? A mystery, I'm afraid. I'm also afraid you will sleep with me in order to get to him. How afraid? Not enough to stop. Can I ask you a personal question? Now would seem an appropriate time. Does \"ellipsis\" mean anything to you? Should I ask him about it? Perhaps later. Yes, dear? I'm on the last flight tonight to Miami. Don't wait up. I'll be back in the morning. Okay, I understand. See you tomorrow. Bye-bye. Apparently he's on the last flight to Miami... ...so you have all night to question me. In that case... ...we're gonna need... ...some more champagne. Good evening. Room Service. Good evening. Can I get a bottle of chilled Bollinger Grand Annee... ...and the beluga caviar? -With everything? -Yes, with everything. -And would that be for two, sir? -What? -For two? -No, for one. Wait here. There you go. Number 53. Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds invites visitors... ...to observe the body's various locomotive, digestive... ...nervous and vascular systems. Please may I have your attention, ladies and gentlemen? I believe it is something very special, what we see here. This is edutainment. ...fixed in dramatic and athletic poses... ...that reveal the true-to-life spatial relationships amongst organs. Hello. Hello. Do not leave your vehicle unattended. Welcome to Miami International Airport. Curbside parking in front of the terminal is restricted.... -Yes. -It's Bond. I need her now. I'm afraid she can't be disturbed. Can I take a message? Listen, you go and find her, tell her to call Security at Miami Airport... ...because I think a bomb is about to go off. Do it now. -Sorry, can I put you on hold? -I thought you might. Bond? What the hell are you up to? I'll call you back. -The Skyfleet S570 prototype. -What about it? \"The largest airplane in the world will be unveiled today at Miami Airport.\" Oh, my God! Bond? Bond! His target is the Skyfleet prototype. It's launching today. I gotta go."

Sorry? Try putting that in a sentence. \"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win... ...continue funding terror and killing.\" That kind of sorry? You lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it.

Well, I'm gonna need the other 5 million to buy back in. I can't do that, James. Look, I made a mistake. I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him. -I'm sorry. -Sorry? Sorry? Try putting that in a sentence. \"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win... ...continue funding terror and killing.\" That kind of sorry? You lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it. That's what this is about. All you're going to do now is lose more. Then you're an idiot. -I'm sorry? -I said, you're a bloody idiot. Look in my eyes. I can beat this man, you know that.

Sorry for disturbing you. -Auf Wiedersehen. -Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel. You know, James... ...I just want you to know that if all that was left of you... ...was your smile and your little finger... ...you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met. That's because you know what I can do with my little finger. -I have no idea. -But you're aching to find out. You're not going to let me in there, are you? You've got your armor back on. That's that. I have no armor left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me.... Whatever is left of me... ...whatever I am... ...I'm yours. I suppose M won't miss me for a couple of days. She'll be too busy sweating Mathis. Mathis? Remember I told you about Le Chiffre's tell? Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre. That's how he wiped me out. Same goes for the implant. Can't say I'm too sorry about losing that. I can't believe it. No, neither could I. I thought he had my back. But there you go, lesson learned. Does everyone have a tell? Yes. Everyone. Everyone except you. I wonder if that's why I love you. You love me?"
