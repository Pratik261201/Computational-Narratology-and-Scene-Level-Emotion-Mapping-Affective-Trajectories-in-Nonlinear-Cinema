If I keep staring at them one moment it'll hit me. Instinctively. Are you a fortune teller? Open up a shop then. Chief, I may know nothing else but my eyes can read people.

The one who was killed? Yeah. She was found with a girdle over her head? Right. Even more important, the night she was killed... that old woman saw Kwang-ho following her. - Really? - That's what I'm saying. I heard that old hag went senile last year. No, she's fine. That kid... Wait. Kwang-ho? What's he look like? This side of his face is a bit... you know. Tell me in detail. Anyways, he's a poor little kid. Kwang-ho. Let's talk man to man. You see a pretty girl you want to do her. When I was your age I'd go out with friends I understand. You never intended to kill Hyang-sook at first, huh? How aboutjust touching her breast... I couldn't touch it. So you killed her? Kill her, then you can touch it. No, I didn't. That guy coming down now he's had a hard life, like you. He's nice. He's really sweet. He never beats anyone.

They grimace and all fucking run away. It's true. I'll kill them all. Everyone who grimaces at my face. I'll kill them all. Those women who grimace they're all in my head. - Hyang-sook too? - Hyang-sook? Hyang-sook. You always followed her around. - Hyang-sook is pretty. - Oh yeah, she's pretty. But Hyang-sook grimaced too, huh? She said, \"Fuck, get away!\" didn't she? Because you liked her. So you killed her, huh? By the train tracks. In that rice paddy. The train tracks? Right. Her throat. Hyang-sook's throat... strangled it tightly. - With what? - Her brassiere. - Brassiere? - With her white brassiere strangled her tightly. - And then? - Her stocking. - Her stocking? - Pulled off her leg. Then it was the stocking. This guy's smart, huh? And then? What? What was it? Something with a strap? A handbag strap? Right, a bag strap. Strangling Hyang-sook's throat with it tightly. And? Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit. She looked completely dead. And then? Her head was covered up. With what? Her panties. Covered her head with her panties. Do you mean a girdle? That women wear? Right, girdle! Looked like it covered her head right up. And then? Um... had to dress her again. And why was that? I don't know. Put the clothes back on. Why was that? How would I know? You were doing well! Bastard! What did you do next? - Then... running! - Where? - It was raining! - Where did you run? - Kept running. - Oh, you little shit! The lightning struck! Where the hell were you running you bastard! Yong-gu, start digging. Huh? Digging? Lightning! Citizens, this is a civil defence drill. The air raid siren has begun to sound. This is only a drill. The entire country is now under a civil defence drill. A blackout is called for in all buildings and houses. Please find cover in the nearest underground space.

Because you won't listen you bastard. - I'm a good boy. - Then tell me! Out here in the fresh air. With that face. Hey, come here. Women hate this face don't they? They grimace and all fucking run away. It's true. I'll kill them all. Everyone who grimaces at my face. I'll kill them all. Those women who grimace they're all in my head. - Hyang-sook too? - Hyang-sook? Hyang-sook. You always followed her around. - Hyang-sook is pretty. - Oh yeah, she's pretty. But Hyang-sook grimaced too, huh? She said, \"Fuck, get away!\" didn't she? Because you liked her. So you killed her, huh? By the train tracks. In that rice paddy. The train tracks? Right. Her throat. Hyang-sook's throat... strangled it tightly. - With what? - Her brassiere. - Brassiere? - With her white brassiere strangled her tightly. - And then? - Her stocking. - Her stocking? - Pulled off her leg. Then it was the stocking. This guy's smart, huh? And then? What? What was it? Something with a strap? A handbag strap? Right, a bag strap. Strangling Hyang-sook's throat with it tightly. And? Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit. She looked completely dead. And then? Her head was covered up. With what? Her panties. Covered her head with her panties. Do you mean a girdle? That women wear? Right, girdle! Looked like it covered her head right up. And then? Um... had to dress her again. And why was that? I don't know. Put the clothes back on. Why was that? How would I know? You were doing well! Bastard! What did you do next? - Then... running! - Where? - It was raining! - Where did you run? - Kept running. - Oh, you little shit! The lightning struck! Where the hell were you running you bastard! Yong-gu, start digging. Huh? Digging? Lightning! Citizens, this is a civil defence drill. The air raid siren has begun to sound. This is only a drill. The entire country is now under a civil defence drill. A blackout is called for in all buildings and houses. Please find cover in the nearest underground space. Follow the instructions you hear in this broadcast. Please move all flammable materials to a safe place. Unplug all cords, then hurry to an underground area... Shut off the lights!"

These guys were a waste of time from the start. Hey! A call from the radio station. I think she found the postcard. I've got the postcard. It has an address. Can you write it down? Jinan 1-ri, Terung District # 32. Park Hyun-gyu. Who are you? We're policemen. Where has Park Hyun-gyu gone? He works at the factory at this time. Hey, Hyun-gyu. Park Hyun-gyu! Park Hyun-gyu! Show me your hands. They're quite smooth. How long have you worked in the factory office? From September last year. Then, a little before the first murder. So after doing your military service you came to this town and the murders all began taking place. Right? Park Hyun-gyu. You sent this postcard to the station. Yes. You sent several others too. Yes. You asked it to be played on rainy days. Yes. \"Sad Letter\". You know that each time this song played a woman was murdered? No. Look at the broadcast records. Okay. The song played yesterday? \"Sad Letter\". Yes. - You listened to the program? - Yes. Your song played at 7:08 and the program finished at 8pm. - You listened to the end? - Yes. - Continuously? - Yes. - What was the final song? - I don't know. - It was yesterday! - I don't remember. - Because you went out! - I was home! She was killed between 7:30 and 8pm. You weren't listening you went out!"

This is the recording of yesterday's program. Last night, you sat listening to this song. Outside the rain was pelting down, you listened and soon you started itching with excitement. There's something you always do when you hear this song. You heard a TV program playing in the room of your landlady you left the lights on in your own room and crept outside.

Four, five... - six, seven, eight... - Shut the fuck up! Yong-gu! I told you not to hit him. Didn't I? You know why journalists snoop around here. You stupid bastard. Don't even think about coming into the interrogation room again. I'm going crazy. No eyewitnesses not one piece of evidence. We need something, shit. Shit, we don't need any damn witnesses. Just a confession will do. Just need to beat that bastard to an inch of his life. You've changed. Try it and, you'll be disgraced. Like with Kwang-ho. Retarded Kwang-ho... I always wanted to ask you. When you dragged him up the mountain he talked about Hyang-sook's death in so much detail. So? Did you really not rehearse that dialogue with him? I told you I didn't! But how did he know the way she was strangled... That's my point! The tape... Where's the tape from the mountain? Miss Kwon? Gui-ok. Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit. She looked completely dead.
