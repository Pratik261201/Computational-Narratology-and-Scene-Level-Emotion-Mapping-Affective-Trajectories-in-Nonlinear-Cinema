Can't stomach the water. -You're my new partner. -That's right. Not the best way to meet, with my head halfway down the toilet. Doesn't exactly square with \"Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,\" -I'll give you that. -The legend? What the hell you boys smoking over there in Portland, anyway? Seattle. I came from the office in Seattle. How long you been with the Marshals? Four years. So you know how small it is. Sure. What about you? You got a girl? Married? I was. She died. -Jesus. I don't... -Don't worry about it. There was a fire at the apartment building while I was at work. Four people died. It was the smoke that got her, not the fire. See, that's important. I'm sorry, boss. Where are my goddamn cigarettes? Oh, here, have one of mine. I could've sworn they were in my jacket before I got on. Government employees will rob you blind. Thanks. They give you a briefing about the institution before you left? All I know is it's a mental hospital. For the criminally insane. Well, if it's just folks running around hearing voices and chasing after butterflies, they wouldn't need us. -Is that where we're headed? -Yep. The other side of the island is rock bluffs all the way down to the edge of the water. The dock, it's the only way on or off. We'll be casting off as soon as you two are ashore. I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry up about it. -Why? -Storm's coming. Never seen a Marshals badge before. I'm Deputy Warden McPherson, gentlemen. Welcome to Shutter Island. I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliffe. Your boys seem a little on edge, Mr. McPherson. Right now, Marshal, we all are. Electrified perimeter. How can you tell? I've seen something like it before. All right. You gentlemen will be accorded all the help we can give, but during your stay, you will obey protocol. Is that understood? Absolutely. The red brick building on your right is Ward A, the male ward. Ward B, the female ward, is the one on your left. Ward C is that building on the bluffs. An old Civil War fort. The most dangerous patients are housed there. Admittance to Ward C is forbidden without the written consent and physical presence of both myself and Dr.",

I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have to fill you in on the situation. Protocol. Correctional officers at a mental institution, that's a weird sight, if you don't mind me saying.

He's created something really unique here. It's a hospital for people our society normally considers beyond treatment. Top of his class at Johns Hopkins, then Harvard... IDs, gentlemen.

McPherson's a good man. He believes in the work we do here. And what would that be, exactly? A moral fusion between law and order and clinical care. Pardon me, Doc. A what between what and what? Those paintings are quite accurate. Used to be the kind of patients we deal with here were shackled and left in their own filth. They were beaten, as if whipping them bloody would drive the psychosis out. We drove screws into their brains, we submerged them in icy water until they lost consciousness or even drowned. -And now? -We treat them. Try to heal, try to cure. And if that fails, at least we provide them with a measure of comfort in their lives. Calm. These are all violent offenders, right? I mean, they've hurt people. -Murdered them in some cases. -In almost all cases, yes.",

I'm not here to judge. -So this female prisoner... -Patient. Excuse me. Patient, one Rachel Solando, escaped sometime in the last 24 hours. -Last night between 10:00 and midnight. -Is she considered dangerous? You could say that. She killed all three of her children. She drowned them in the lake behind her house. She took them out one by one, held their heads under till they died, then she brought them back inside and arranged them around the kitchen table. She ate a meal there before a neighbor dropped by. And what about the husband? He died on the beaches of Normandy. She's a war widow. She starved herself when she first came here. She insisted the children weren't dead. Sorry, Doctor. You don't happen to have an aspirin, do you? -Prone to headaches, Marshal? -Sometimes. But today, -I'm a little more prone to seasickness. -Ah, dehydration. -You all right, boss? -Yeah. In that case, you're quite right. The simpler the better. Thanks so much. Rachel still believes the children are alive. She also believes this place is her home in the Berkshires. -You're kidding me. -She's never once in two years acknowledged that she's in an institution. She believes we're all deliverymen, milkmen, postal workers. To sustain the delusion that her children never died, she's created an elaborate fictional structure, and she gives us all parts to play in that fiction. So have you searched the grounds yet? The warden and his men scoured the island. Not a trace. And what's more disturbing is we don't know how she got out of her room. It was locked from the outside, and the only window is barred. It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls. I brought her right back here after group therapy, locked her in, came back for midnight rounds, she was gone. Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible that the truth never gets through to her? I mean, she's in a mental institution, right? Seems like something you'd notice from time to time. How many pairs of shoes are the patients given? Two pairs. Sanity's not a choice, Marshal. You can't just choose to get over it. So, she left here barefoot? Come on, Doc, she couldn't get 10 yards in that terrain.",

The bases of those cliffs are covered in poison ivy, live oak, sumac, a thousand plants with thorns as big as my dick. You said yourself, Marshal, she's got no shoes. All right, let's check the other side. -What's that tower? -It's an old lighthouse. The guards already searched inside it. What's in there? More patients? Sewage treatment facility. It's getting dark soon. I'm calling this off for tonight. Let's go, boys! You were on watch on the landing, huh? Yeah. Couldn't nobody get in or out of their room on that corridor without me seeing. Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does she have to pass to get down here? Me. Glen Miga. Sir, I didn't see nothing. And you were at your post all night? Yeah, but I didn't see a thing.",

It's getting dark soon. I'm calling this off for tonight. Let's go, boys! You were on watch on the landing, huh? Yeah. Couldn't nobody get in or out of their room on that corridor without me seeing. Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does she have to pass to get down here? Me. Glen Miga. Sir, I didn't see nothing. And you were at your post all night? Yeah, but I didn't see a thing."

No, no, no, boss. Luck doesn't work that way. The world doesn't work that way. They got an electrified fence around a septic facility. Ward C is inside a Civil War fort? A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS? Funding from HUAC?

We came here for Rachel Solando. Where's one shred of evidence she even existed? There's no way they could've known I'd be assigned to this case. There's no way. What if while you were looking into them, they were looking into you? All they had to do was fake an escape to get you here, and now they have you. Now they have us both. Here! Now! This is Deputy Warden McPherson. Marshals! How about that? They found us, huh? It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us. I know you're in there. We're getting off this goddamn island. You and me. Come on. -Come on! -Go, go! Get dried off. Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now. And hurry up! This thing is turning into a goddamn hurricane! I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.

        "Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison. -And you found him. -Yeah, I found him. Well, he's a mess. But it's pretty clear from what he tells me. What? They're experimenting on people here. I don't know, boss. -How do you believe a crazy guy? -That's the beauty of it, isn't it? Crazy people, they're the perfect subjects. They talk, nobody listens. I stood at Dachau. We saw what human beings are capable of doing to each other, right? For Christ's sakes, we fought a goddamn war to stop them, and now... Now I find out it may be happening here? On our soil? No. So what are you really here to do, Ted? I'm gonna get the proof, I'm gonna go back, and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place. That's it. Wait a minute. You started asking around about Ashecliffe, waiting for a chance to get out here, and then suddenly they need a U.S. Marshal? Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient escape. It was the perfect excuse. No, no, no, boss. Luck doesn't work that way. The world doesn't work that way. They got an electrified fence around a septic facility. Ward C is inside a Civil War fort? A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS? Funding from HUAC? I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about this place stinks of government ops. -What if they wanted you here? -Bullshit. -You were asking questions. -Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit. We came here for Rachel Solando. Where's one shred of evidence she even existed? There's no way they could've known I'd be assigned to this case. There's no way. What if while you were looking into them, they were looking into you? All they had to do was fake an escape to get you here, and now they have you. Now they have us both. Here! Now! This is Deputy Warden McPherson. Marshals! How about that? They found us, huh? It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us. I know you're in there. We're getting off this goddamn island. You and me. Come on. -Come on! -Go, go! Get dried off. Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now. And hurry up! This thing is turning into a goddamn hurricane! I dropped those suits off to be cleaned. Should be ready by tomorrow. That is, if we all don't wash away first. You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes are pretty much done for. So... This is our only choice, huh?

I found her, Doctor, in a cave out by the cliffs. -But you'll never get to her. -I don't doubt it, considering she's not real. Your delusions are more severe than I thought. You're not on neuroleptics. You're not on anything, as a matter of fact. Then what the fuck is this? Huh? What the fuck is this? Withdrawal. Withdrawal? From what? I haven't had a goddamn drink since I've been on this island. Chlorpromazine. I'm not a fan of pharmacology, but I have to say, in your case... Chloraproma-what? -Chlorpromazine. The same thing we've been giving you for the past 24 months. Oh, so for the past two years, you... You've had somebody slipping me drugs in Boston. Is that it? Not Boston. Here. You've been here for two years. A patient of this institution. After everything I've seen here, Doctor, you really think you're gonna convince me I'm crazy, huh?",

If the world thinks that Chuck is dead, then he's perfect for their experiments. There's only one place they'd take him. -You go there and you'll die. -He's my partner. If they are hurting him, if they're holding him against his will, I've gotta bring him out. I can't lose anyone else. Don't go, Teddy, please. -Please, don't do this. Don't go. -I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry, honey. I love this thing because you gave it to me, but the truth is it is one fucking ugly tie. No. Don't move. Stay where you are. Are you gonna kill me? No, I'm not gonna kill you. Why are you all wet, baby? -What did you say? -You know exactly what I said. The rifle's empty, by the way. Have a seat. For God's sake, dry off. You'll catch cold. All right. How badly did you hurt the guard? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, he's here. Have Dr. Sheehan take a look at your man before you send him up.

I wanna go home. You are home. Where are the kids? Hmm? They're in school. It's Saturday, honey. School's not in on Saturday. My school is. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, no. Come on, come on. No. No. Please, God. Please, God, no! No! No. Baby. Let's put them at the table, Andrew. We'll dry them off. We'll change their clothes. They'll be our living dolls. Huh? Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic. If you ever loved me, Dolores, please stop talking."

Andrew, can you hear me? Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. Rachel? Rachel who? Rachel. Rachel Laeddis. My daughter. Why are you here? Because I killed my wife. And why did you do that? Because she murdered our children, and she told me to let her go. -Who's Teddy Daniels? -He doesn't exist. Neither does Rachel Solando. I made them up. -Why? -We need to hear you say it. After she tried to kill herself the first time, Dolores told me she... She had an insect living inside her brain. She could feel it clicking across her skull, just pulling the wires just for fun. She told me that. She told me that, but I didn't listen. I loved her so much, you know. Why did you make them up? Because I can't take knowing that Dolores killed our children. And I... I killed them 'cause I didn't get her help, you know. I killed them. Here's my fear, Andrew. We broke through once before, nine months ago, and then you regressed. -I don't remember that. -I know. You reset, Andrew. Like a tape playing over and over on an endless loop. I hope that what we've done here will be enough to stop it from ever happening again, but I need to know you've accepted reality. You came after me, huh, Doctor? You tried to help me when no one else would. My name's Andrew Laeddis, and I murdered my wife in the spring of '52. How we doing this morning? -Good. And you? -Can't complain. So what's our next move? You tell me. We gotta get off this rock, Chuck. Get back to the mainland. Whatever the hell's going on here, it's bad. Don't worry, partner, they're not gonna catch us. That's right. We're too smart for them. Yeah, we are, aren't we? You know, this place makes me wonder... Yeah, what's that, boss? Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?
