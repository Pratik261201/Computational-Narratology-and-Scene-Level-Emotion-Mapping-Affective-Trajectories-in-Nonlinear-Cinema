      "raw_text": "People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden. Three minutes. This is it. Ground zero. Would you like to say a few words for the occasion? With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels. I can't think of anything. For a second, totally I forget about Tyler's controlled demolition thing and I wonder how clean that gun is. It's getting exciting now. That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both ways. We have front-row seats for this theatre of mass destruction. The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin. In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges and a few square blocks will be reduced to smouldering rubble. I know this because Tyler knows this. Two and a half. Think of everything we've accomplished. Suddenly I realize that all of this, the gun, the bombs, the revolution, has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer. Bob. Bob had bitch tits. This was a support group for men with testicular cancer. The big moosie slobbering all over me, that was Bob. We're still men. Yes, we're men. Men is what we are. Eight months ago, Bob's testicles were removed. Then hormone therapy. He developed bitch tits 'cause his testosterone was too high and his body upped the oestrogen. That was where I fit. I think they're gonna have to open up my pecs again and drain the fluid. Between those huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way you'd think of God's as big. Okay , you cry now. No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier. For six months, I couldn't sleep. I couldn't sleep... With insomnia, nothing's real. Everything's far away. Everything's a copy of a copy of a copy. When deep-space exploration ramps up, it'll be the corporations that name everything. The IBM Stellar Sphere. The Microsoft Galaxy. The Planet Starbucks. I need you out of town a little more this week. We've got some red flags to cover. It must have been Tuesday. He was wearing his cornflower-blue tie. You want me to deprioritise my reports until you advise of a status upgrade? Make these your primary action items. Here's your flight coupons. Call me from the road if there's any snags. He was full of pep. Must have had his grande latte enema.",

We used to read pornography. Now it was the Horchow collection. - No. You can't die from insomnia. - What about narcolepsy? I nod off, I wake up in strange places. I have no idea how I got there. - You need to lighten up. - Can you please just give me something? Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals... No. You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew some valerian root and get more exercise. - Hey, come on. I'm in pain. - You wanna see pain? Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights. See the guys with testicular cancer. That's pain. I always wanted three kids. Two boys and a girl. Mindy wanted two girls and a boy. We never could agree on anything. Well, she had her first child last week. A girl. With her... with her new husband. And thank God. You know? I-I'm glad for her. Because she deserves it. Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us. Thank you, Thomas. I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage. And that gives me strength. We give each other strength. It's time for the one-on-ones. So let's all of us follow Thomas' good example and really open ourselves up. Could you find a partner? And this is how I met the big moosie. His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears. Knees together. Those awkward little steps. - My name is Bob. - Bob? Bob had been a champion body builder. You know that chest expansion program you see on late-night TV? That was his idea. I was a juicer. You know - using steroids. Diabonal and... Wisterol.

You can cry. And then... something happened. I let go. That's really good. Lost in oblivion. Dark and silent and complete. I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom. It's okay. Babies don't sleep this well. I became addicted. If I didn't say anything, people always assumed the worst. They cried harder... then I cried harder. Now we're going to open the green door, the heart chakra... I wasn't really dying. I wasn't host to cancer or parasites. I was the warm little centre that the life of this world crowded around. Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light. It moves over your body, healing you. Now keep this going. Remember to breathe. And step forward through the back door of the room. Where does it lead? To your cave. Step forward into your cave. That's right. You're going deeper into your cave, and you're going to find your power animal. Slide. Every evening I died. And every evening I was born again. Resurrected. Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too. Being there, pressed against his tits, ready to cry. This was my vacation. And she... ruined everything. This is cancer, right? This chick, Marla Singer, did not have testicular cancer. She was a liar. She had no diseases at all. I had seen her at Free and Clear, my blood parasites group, Thursdays. Then at Hope, my bimonthly sickle-cell circle. And again at Seize the Day, my tuberculosis, Friday night. Marla, the big tourist. Her lie reflected my lie. And suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn't cry. So once again, I couldn't sleep. Next group, after guided meditation, after we open our heart chakras, when it's time to hug, I'm gonna grab that bitch Marla Singer and scream: Marla, you liar! You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out! I hadn't slept in four days. We'll just let that dry... When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep and you're never really awake. To begin tonight's communion, Chloe would like to say a few words. Oh, yeah. Chloe. Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around a party being extra nice to everybody.",

It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee's. Look, this is important. These are my groups. I've been coming for over a year. - Why do you do it? - I don't know. When people think you're dying, then they really really listen to you instead of just... Instead of waiting for their turn to speak. Yeah. Yeah. Share yourself, completely. Look, you don't want to get into this. It becomes an addiction. - Really? - I'm not kidding. I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this. So you gotta find somewhere else to go.

It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee's. Look, this is important. These are my groups. I've been coming for over a year. - Why do you do it? - I don't know. When people think you're dying, then they really really listen to you instead of just... Instead of waiting for their turn to speak. Yeah. Yeah. Share yourself, completely. Look, you don't want to get into this. It becomes an addiction. - Really? - I'm not kidding. I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this. So you gotta find somewhere else to go. Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem. Wait a second. Hold on. I'll tell you. We're gonna split up the week, okay? You take lymphoma and tuberculosis. You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all."

If you look for them, you can see little dots come into the upper right corner of the screen. In the industry, we call them cigarette burns. That's the cue for a changeover.

      "raw_text": "I'm a 30-year-old boy. We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need. Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet. But every Saturday night, we were finding something out. We were finding out more and more that we were not alone. It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo. Polish my Scandinavian furniture. I should have been looking for a new condo. I should have been haggling with my insurance company. I should have been upset about my nice, neat, flaming little shit, but I wasn't. The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient. Monday mornings, all I thought about was next week. Can I get the icon in cornflower blue? Absolutely. Efficiency is priority no. 1, people. Because waste is a thief. I showed this to my man here. You liked it, didn't you? You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick. It was right in everyone's face. Tyler and I just made it visible. It was on the tip of everyone's tongue. Tyler and I just gave it a name. Come on, people, you've gotta go home! Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back. Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided. Gentlemen! Welcome to Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is... you do not talk about Fight Club! Third rule of Fight Club: someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out, the fight is over. Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas. Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes. Seventh rule: fights will go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule: if this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to fight. This kid from work, Ricky, couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black. But Ricky was a god for ten minutes when he trounced the maître d' of a local food court.

        "I'm a 30-year-old boy. We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need. Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet. But every Saturday night, we were finding something out. We were finding out more and more that we were not alone. It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo. Polish my Scandinavian furniture. I should have been looking for a new condo. I should have been haggling with my insurance company. I should have been upset about my nice, neat, flaming little shit, but I wasn't. The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient. Monday mornings, all I thought about was next week. Can I get the icon in cornflower blue? Absolutely. Efficiency is priority no. 1, people. Because waste is a thief. I showed this to my man here. You liked it, didn't you? You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick. It was right in everyone's face. Tyler and I just made it visible. It was on the tip of everyone's tongue. Tyler and I just gave it a name. Come on, people, you've gotta go home! Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back. Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided. Gentlemen! Welcome to Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is... you do not talk about Fight Club! Third rule of Fight Club: someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out, the fight is over. Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas. Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes. Seventh rule: fights will go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule: if this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to fight. This kid from work, Ricky, couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black. But Ricky was a god for ten minutes when he trounced the maître d' of a local food court. Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard, packing sounds over the yelling. Or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed... Stop! You weren't alive anywhere like you were there. But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and when Fight Club ends. Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man."

I'd fight William Shatner. We all started seeing things differently. Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up. I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms, trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should. Is that what a man looks like? Ah, self-improvement is masturbation. Now, self-destruction... Excuse me. Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing. It wasn't about words. The hysterical shouting was in tongues, like at a Pentecostal Church. - Is that it? - Stop!

New guy, you too. Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me. He fell down some stairs. I fell down some stairs. Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails. Okay. Any historical figure. - I'd fight Gandhi. - Good answer. - How about you? - Lincoln. Lincoln? Big guy, big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger. Fuck! Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart. Hello? Where have you been the last eight weeks? Marla? - How did you find me? - You left a forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups. We split 'em up. That was the idea. Remember? Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours. - How do you know? - I cheated. I found a new one. - Really? - It's for men only. Like the testicle thing? - Look, this is a bad time. - I've been going to Debtors Anonymous. - You wanna see some really fucked-up people... - I'm just on my way out. Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax. I took what was left of a bottle. It might have been too much. Just picture watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment. This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably just a cry for help things. This could go on for hours. - So you're staying in tonight then? - Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death?

You are not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fucking khakis. You are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. I'll be out of your way in a sec. You don't have to go. Whatever. No, I mean... it's okay. Are you still going to groups? Yeah. Chloe's dead. Wow. Chloe. When did that happen? Do you care? I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while. Yeah, well... it was the smart move on her part. Listen, um... What are you getting out of all this? What? I mean, all this. Why do you keep... Is this making you happy? Yeah, well, sometimes. I don't know. I don't understand. Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person? What is that? What do you get out of it? No... That's not the same thing at all. It's totally different with us. \"Us\"? - What do you mean by \"us\"? - I'm sorry. Do you hear this? - Hear what? - You're not hearing all that noise? Hold on a second. No, wait! What were you saying? Don't change the subject! I want to talk about this. - You're not talking about me, are you? - No. What? That day you came over to my place, playing doctor. What was going on there? - What are you talking about? - Nothing. Nothing. - I don't think so. - What do you want? - Look at me. - No. What? Look at me. - What is that? - It's nothing. Don't worry about it."

Oh, my God. - 1888. - Who am I calling? 1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello? Hello? Franklin Street? Yes. Can I help you? - Hello? - Yeah, yeah. I need to talk to your supervisor right away. - Speaking. - Okay, listen to me. I think something really terrible is about to happen to your building. It's under control, sir. - Excuse me? - Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid. 2160. Marla! Marla! Hey, Marla, wait! Marla, wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla! Your whack-out bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom! They almost broke my arm! They were burning their fingertips with lye. - The stink was unbelievable. - Look, listen to me. It'll take a tremendous act of faith on your part, but you gotta hear me out. - Here comes an avalanche of bullshit. - A little more faith than that. Listen, I don't wanna hear anything you have to say. You have every right to be... I'll just have a coffee, thanks. Sir, anything you order is free of charge, sir. - Why is it free of charge?",

Technically, you're fucking Marla. But it's all the same to her. Oh, my God. Now you see our dilemma. She knows too much. I think we're gonna have to talk about how this might compromise our goals. What... What are you saying? This is... This is bullshit. This is bullshit! I'm not listening to this. - You are insane! - No. You're insane. And we simply do not have time for this crap.

One step closer to economic equilibrium. - Why is she here? - Tying up loose ends. Put me down, you bald-headed fuck! - I'm begging you, please don't do this. - I'm not doing this. We are doing this. - This is what we want. - No. I don't want this. Right. Except \"you\" is meaningless now. We have to forget about you. - You're a voice in my head. - You're a voice in mine! - You're a fucking hallucination. Why can't I get rid of you? - You need me. No. I don't. I really don't anymore. You created me. I didn't create some loser alter ego to make me feel better. - Take some responsibility. - I do. I am responsible for all of it, and I accept that. So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off. Have I ever let us down?"
