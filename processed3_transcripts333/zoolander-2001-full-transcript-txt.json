      "raw_text": "Here in Malaysia, there is an almost overwhelming sense of euphoria, as the newly-elected prime minister has given this impoverished nation the gift of hope, promising to raise the substandard minimum wage and end child labour once and for all. Already considered a living saint, he has become this small country's greatest hope, for a thriving future in the new millennium. Get closer, Jaco. This is disgusting. How could you let this happen? I have negotiated my butt off, Giorgio. I've tried bribes, I've tried gifts. I even sent him some pet oxen. I mean, they love that crap in Malaysia, but he won't budge. Listen, 50% of my inventory is manufactured in sweatshops on the Malaysian border. Something has got to be done. If Malaysia goes, what is next? My entire panty line is made in Vietnam. We'll all go bankrupt within a year. The Malaysian must be eliminated, Mugatu. What? No, I don't have time for this. Perhaps you'd rather go back to turning out novelty neckties in Hackensack. But my new fall line is almost due. And I trust you would like to live to see your spring line, as well? The Malaysian prime minister visits New York in 14 days. Do it then. Fourteen days? That's Fashion Week. It's impossible! I have a show! It's perfect. Invite him to be your guest of honour. That's not enough time. It takes months to train an operative. What about Fabio? Too smart. This is a rush job. He's got to be extremely dim-witted. - You know the profile, Jacobim. - A beautiful, self-absorbed, simpleton who can be manipulated and moulded like Jell-O. Or cookie dough. - Or Play-Doh. - Any kind of dough. The point is, we need an empty vessel, a shallow, dumb, vacuous moron. And when he's finished, we'll dispose of him. But who? I mean, where in all of God's green goodness, am I gonna find someone that beef-headed? Derek, I just have a few more questions, if that's okay. Cool. So when did you know you wanted to be a model? I guess it would have to be the first time I went through the second grade. I caught my reflection in a spoon while I was eating my cereal, and I remember thinking, \"Wow, you're ridiculously good-looking.\" - \"Maybe you could do that for a career.\" - Do what? - Be professionally good-looking. - Right. What would you say your trademark is, if you have one?",

It's a bit more of a catalogue look. - I use it for footwear sometimes. - Can I see that? Look, without Derek Zoolander, male modelling wouldn't be what it is today. He is a fashion icon. So, do you spend a lot of time working on these looks, thinking about them? Sure. I've been working on Magnum for at least eight or nine years. \"Magnum\"? That's intriguing. Can I see that? Are you kidding? I shouldn't even be talking about it. It's nowhere near ready. It's almost like there's a light around him. He exudes beauty. I think about Derek every time I design a collection. Derek, I don't know if you're familiar with the belief that some aboriginal tribes hold. It's the concept that a photo might steal a part of your soul. What are your thoughts on that, as someone who gets his picture taken for a living? That Blue Steel look he does? Oh, my gosh! The style and the hair. You know, it's almost like the new afro for the white man, but it's beautiful. Well, I guess I would have to answer your question with another question. How many \"abo-digitals\" do you see modelling? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the fashion industry's biggest night, the VH 1 Fashion Awards. There he is, three-time Male Model of the Year, Derek Zoolander. He's like music. Proud owner of Blue Steel, the look that made him the legend he now is. He's almost too good-looking. Hey, Paco! That would be my main deterrent in considering a relationship. And that's who Derek Zoolander is defending his title against tonight. Hansel. - Hansel, right here! - All right, all right. The rookie sensation who has burned his way into the eye sockets of the fashion world, and left them clawing their faces for more. Mugatu sucks! Support the prime minister! Mugatu uses slave labour! Down with Mugatu! You hate to see something like that at an event like this. Ugly protesters bothering beautiful people. There's no denying Jacobim Mugatu has used cheap Malaysian workers to make his, and most of the garment industry's, clothes. - Derek! Derek! - Hey, Steve, how are you doing? You're going for your fourth straight Male Model of the Year award tonight.",

This Malaysian thing is getting out of hand. I hear you, Jaco. What this, the Slashie, mean, is you consider me the best actor slash model, and not the other way around. His proposed wage increase could ruin all of us. I need it taken care of soon. I have people to answer to. All right, now to the important stuff. These ain't no slashes, folks. These are the pure breeds. Here are the nominees for Male Model of the Year. Young, hot, brash. With more covers in his first year than any rookie model ever and an attitude that says, \"Who cares? It's only fashion.\" That Hansel's so hot right now.

Over the past decade, male modelling has had a shadow cast over it by one man and five syllables, Derek Zoolander. Modelling, to me, isn't just about being good-looking, or having a lot of fun and being really, really good-looking. The calendar was great, because it gave people a chance to see a side of my versatility. The original Greek word for model means \"misshapen ball of clay\", and I try to think about that every time I get in front of a camera. Three-time Male Model of the Year. And the award goes to Hansel. Thank you, Lenny. Wow! You know, a lot of people said winning this award four years in a row couldn't happen. Well, I guess I showed... I think we've found our solution, Ballstein. No, not Derek. He's perfect, and you know it. Now make it happen. It stings me like a fissure in my ass, but you're right. He's ready. Who am I? I don't know. I guess I have a lot of things to ponder. Hey, the results are in, amigo! What's left to ponder? Nice comeback! I can't stand Hansel! I know, right? Riding in on that scooter like he's so cool. - And the way Hansel combs his hair. - Or, like, doesn't. It's like, \"'Ex-squeeze' me, but have you ever heard of styling gel?\" I'm sure Hansel's heard of styling gel. He's a male model. Earth to Brint. I was making a joke. Earth to Meekus. Duh, okay? I knew that. Earth to Brint. I'm not so sure you did 'cause you were all, \"Well, I'm sure he's heard of styling gel.\" Like you didn't know it was a joke. I knew it was a joke, Meekus. I just didn't get it right away. - Earth to Brint... - Would you guys stop it already! Did you ever think that maybe there's more to life than being really, really, really, ridiculously good-looking?",

The calendar was great, because it gave people a chance to see a side of my versatility. The original Greek word for model means \"misshapen ball of clay\", and I try to think about that every time I get in front of a camera. Three-time Male Model of the Year. And the award goes to Hansel. Thank you, Lenny. Wow! You know, a lot of people said winning this award four years in a row couldn't happen. Well, I guess I showed... I think we've found our solution, Ballstein. No, not Derek. He's perfect, and you know it. Now make it happen. It stings me like a fissure in my ass, but you're right. He's ready. Who am I? I don't know. I guess I have a lot of things to ponder. Hey, the results are in, amigo! What's left to ponder? Nice comeback! I can't stand Hansel! I know, right? Riding in on that scooter like he's so cool. - And the way Hansel combs his hair. - Or, like, doesn't. It's like, \"'Ex-squeeze' me, but have you ever heard of styling gel?\" I'm sure Hansel's heard of styling gel. He's a male model. Earth to Brint. I was making a joke. Earth to Meekus. Duh, okay? I knew that. Earth to Brint. I'm not so sure you did 'cause you were all, \"Well, I'm sure he's heard of styling gel.\" Like you didn't know it was a joke. I knew it was a joke, Meekus. I just didn't get it right away. - Earth to Brint... - Would you guys stop it already! Did you ever think that maybe there's more to life than being really, really, really, ridiculously good-looking?"

You know what could really help you sort through these important issues? What? - Orange mocha frappuccino! - Orange mocha frappuccino! - Yeah! - Yeah! Come on, man! Come on! \"Derek Zoolander. A model idiot.\" - Brint! - Huh? No! Rufus, Brint and Meekus were like brothers to me. And when I say brother, I don't mean like an actual brother, but I mean it like the way black people use it, which is more meaningful, I think.

A \"eugoogolizer.\" One who speaks at funerals. Or did you think I'd be too stupid to know what a \"eugoogoly\" was? How could you have written those terrible things about me? Look, Derek, my editor put that headline on it, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know it came off kind of harsh. Yeah, well, fortunately for you, not too many people I know read your little Time magazine, or whatever it's called. Look, maybe you could do me a favour.

Without much further ado, I give you the Derek Zoolander Centre for Kids Who Can't Read Good. What is this? A center for ants? What? How can we be expected to teach children to learn how to read, if they can't even fit inside the building? - Derek, it's just a small... - I don't want to hear your excuses! The center has to be at least three times bigger than this. - He's absolutely right. - Thank you. I have a vision. And so do I. Let me show you mine. I can't help you, lady. I don't know nothing about Mugatu. But you've represented every male model in each of his campaigns. You must have some kind of a relationship with him. Even if I did, why would I talk to you? Shame on you how you picked on Derek Zoolander in that story. He's a sweet simpleton who never hurt a fly. Please don't change the subject, Mr Ballstein. What about Mugatu's exploitation of sweatshop workers in Malaysia? - Do you have an opinion on that? - You wanna hear an opinion? With a push-up bra, you could have a nice rack of lamb going on there. Let me show you the future of fashion. Let me show you Derelicte! It is a fashion, a way of life, inspired by the very homeless, the vagrants, the crack whores that make this wonderful city so unique. And I want you, Derek, to be the face, the image, nay, the spirit of Derelicte! It'll be your glorious comeback. Sounds cool. Derek, I'd like you to meet Katinka Ingabogovinanana. She'll be your day-to-day on the campaign. Let's get this model on his way! The big show is in eight days, Derek. Like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, so must you become Derelicte! So you want me to sleep in the gutter? No. We're sending you to a very exclusive day spa. So exclusive, no one knows about it. Our little secret, okay? - Matilda, hey. - Hey, Arch, what's up? Nothing. I've just been up for a few days, putting together these background articles on Mugatu you asked for. Wow! Very thorough, Archie. Thank you.",

I just thought the way you handled losing that award to Hansel, and then you sort of laid low for a while, and then made your comeback... It was so courageous.

When are you gonna drop Magnum on us, buddy? Not yet. Gotta tame the beast before you let it out of its cage. - Excuse me, bro. - You're excused. And I'm not your bro. Whatever, dude. Whatever. Peace. God bless. Hey, Hansel, I'm sorry you didn't get Mugatu's Derelicte campaign. Maybe next time. What's that? Mugatu's Derelicte campaign. Sorry you didn't book it. Oh, yeah?

Tripping on acid changed our whole perspective on shit. So I guess you can Dere-lick my balls, cápitan. Would you hold this for me? I can Dere-lick my own balls, thank you very much. You think you're too cool for school. But I got a news flash for you, Walter Cronkite. You aren't. Who are you trying to get crazy with, ese? Don't you know I'm loco? Hey, I got a wacky idea. What say we settle this on the runway? Han-solo? Stop it. Are you challenging me to a walk-off Boo-lander? Don't do this, Derek. Listen to your friend Billy Zane. He's a cool dude. He's trying to help you out. Oh, yeah. That's a walk-off challenge, my friend. Ten minutes. Old Members Only warehouse. You oughta remember that. You're a dinosaur. Let's go. Open up. I heard some mad stories about this kid. He's limber. He's too limber. Put a cork in it, Zane! It's a walk-off. Walk-off. This is urgent, ma'am. Do you have any... Derek? Derek! Derek! Hey, Matilda. What is this? Where is everyone going? Good luck, Derek!",

I don't want to hang out, okay? I just need to speak with Derek Zoolander, please! I just thought the way you handled losing that award to Hansel, and then you sort of laid low for a while, and then made your comeback... It was so courageous. Look, I gotta go pee, but I'd really like to continue talking about this conversation when I come back. Yeah. - Everything cool, Derek? - It's great, Biff. Thank you. Hey, Derek. You rule. Thanks, Paris. I appreciate that. - Hey, Derek. - Hey, Maurice. - Hey, my man. - What's happening? Derek, back on top, man. Thanks, Billy. You rock. No, you rock. When are you gonna drop Magnum on us, buddy? Not yet. Gotta tame the beast before you let it out of its cage. - Excuse me, bro. - You're excused. And I'm not your bro. Whatever, dude. Whatever.

I don't know. Think, okay? This is important! I hate Hansel! Hansel, Hansel! Everywhere I look! Hansel! Hansel, Hansel! Were you looking for a rematch? Excuse me, Hansel. I don't think there's an easy way to put this, so I am just gonna lay it out. Derek has been brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. And? And we need a place to hide until we figure this whole thing out. Derek said this would probably be the last place anyone would look for him. Yeah, you're cool to hide here. But first, me and him got to straighten some shit out. Fine. Why you been acting so messed up towards me? Well, you go first. I don't know. Maybe I felt a little threatened or something, 'cause your career is, kind of, just blossoming, and mine's, kind of, winding down or whatever. And I felt like, \"This guy's really hurting me,\" and it hurt. And I felt like when you told me to Dere-lick my balls, that really hurt. Maybe I was scared, man. You're Derek Zoolander!"
