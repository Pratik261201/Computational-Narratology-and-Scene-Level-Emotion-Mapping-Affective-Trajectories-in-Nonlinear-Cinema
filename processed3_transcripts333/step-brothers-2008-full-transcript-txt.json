Now, hold it right here. Great. Dale. Dale, I'm leaving for the conference. - You leave me money for pizza, Dad? - Yeah, there's $20 on the hall table. Do not order pay-per-view, buddy. - But what if I want wings? - You don't need wings. That's not enough, Dad! The RTI cochlear implant... ...is the state-of-the-art implantable hearing device... ...due to its input processing of sound via the speech processor. But the most exciting new development... ...is the external processor... ...which fits directly over the ear... ...which eliminates the need to put your face between those breasts. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm so lost. And this never happens to me. My name is Robert, and I play racquetball. I collect coins. Sweet Jesus! I love Korean food. I am Nancy Huff. I know how to make tandoori chicken... ...I contribute to NPR every single year... ...and I love the movies of Rob Reiner. Pilates changed my life. I have a boat, and I wanna retire and sail around the world. - I love the sea! - And I drive a Mercedes... ...and I have a 40-year-old son, Dale, who still lives at home. - What did you just say? - I knew I shouldn't have told you that. I have a 39-year-old son named Brennan... ...who still lives at home with me. I would like to thank all of you... ...for being here with us on this fantastic, wonderful day. And I would like to raise my glass. Dale and I wanna welcome you to our home with open arms. - Get a room, Dad. - Oh, for chri... Dale! Well, as you all know, my youngest son, Derek, couldn't be here... ...because of an important fishing trip. But my other son, Brennan, was going to be moving into his own place... ...but he was recently let go from his job at PetSmart... ...so he is gonna be living with us. I wasn't fired from my job, I was laid off! But you wouldn't know the difference. I didn't want salmon! I said it four times. This wedding is horseshit. Somebody's awfully quiet back there. I'm not gonna call him Dad. Brennan, you're 39 years old. I would not expect you to call him Dad. Well, I'm not going to, ever. Even if there's a fire. Robert better not get in my face...",

I don't believe in belts. There should be no ranking system for toughness. But one time I wrestled a giraffe to the ground with my bare hands. That's not true, Dale. Don't be ridiculous. So, Dale, what have you been working on recently? Well... ...I manage a baseball team. - Little League? - Fantasy league. Take a picture. It'll last longer.

I know you used to work at PetSmart. - That's right, Mr. Doback. - Call me Robert. - That's right, Robin. - Robert. Robin. Actually, Brennan is a really talented person. He's a very gifted singer. - I'm really, really good. - How good? I've been called the songbird of my generation... ...by people who've heard me. That good. The only trick is is that Brennan's very... ...particular about who he sings in front of, so... I'm his mom, for example, I've only heard him sing twice.

Brennan, it's okay. It's okay. Hey, hey. - Great, Dale. - He said a mean thing first. All right, just... Look, you know what...? Hey, guys. Okay, sleeping arrangements. It's gonna be different... ...but because Dale refuses to give up his office drum set... ...that means that, Brennan, you and Dale are gonna have to share a room. - But it's just temporary. - Mom, we didn't talk about this. Well, it's gonna be an exciting adventure. You wanna show him the room, Dale? Show him where he can put his stuff? - That's nice, thank you. - Good night, Nancy. Hey, listen, I like to have a lot of fresh fruit around... ...and chocolate chips in my pancakes. Okay? - Write it so you don't forget. - Show him the room. She's Mom now, so... - Good night, Mom. - Good night, Brennan. - Good night, Mr. Doback. - Good night, Brennan. So just a few basic rules about the house. If there's any foods that you like... ...I suggest you put your name on them, or they will be thrown out. By me. House was built in 1825 by General Custer. I wanna show you this room. Hold up. - You see this room? - Yeah. Okay, here's the deal. This is my office and my beat laboratory. Okay? And this is the one rule of the house: Don't ever, ever, ever... ...touch my drum set. - You understand? - Don't go in there and... - No touching! - All right! There. I was at about six there. You don't wanna see me go to 10. Get your shit. We're going to my room. Honey? I just found a chain of islands that we can sail to after New Zealand. That's wonderful. You know, I've been meaning to ask you... Why is it that Dale never left? Well, Dale has always coasted off my accomplishments. I mean, he left college his junior year... ...because he said he wanted to join the family business. - But you're a medical doctor. - Believe me, I've told him that.

        "- Why don't you jump right in? It's a crotch party right up in here - Stop it! - Why don't you lick on this big joint? Stop it, Dale! Stop it! Stop it! That's cute. I remember when I had my first beer. That's so funny, the last time I heard that... ...I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur. Stop right now. All right? Let's just back off. All right. Brennan, it's okay. It's okay. Hey, hey. - Great, Dale. - He said a mean thing first. All right, just... Look, you know what...? Hey, guys. Okay, sleeping arrangements. It's gonna be different... ...but because Dale refuses to give up his office drum set... ...that means that, Brennan, you and Dale are gonna have to share a room. - But it's just temporary. - Mom, we didn't talk about this. Well, it's gonna be an exciting adventure. You wanna show him the room, Dale? Show him where he can put his stuff? - That's nice, thank you. - Good night, Nancy. Hey, listen, I like to have a lot of fresh fruit around... ...and chocolate chips in my pancakes. Okay? - Write it so you don't forget. - Show him the room. She's Mom now, so... - Good night, Mom. - Good night, Brennan. - Good night, Mr. Doback. - Good night, Brennan. So just a few basic rules about the house. If there's any foods that you like... ...I suggest you put your name on them, or they will be thrown out. By me. House was built in 1825 by General Custer. I wanna show you this room. Hold up. - You see this room? - Yeah. Okay, here's the deal. This is my office and my beat laboratory. Okay? And this is the one rule of the house: Don't ever, ever, ever... ...touch my drum set. - You understand? - Don't go in there and... - No touching! - All right! There. I was at about six there. You don't wanna see me go to 10. Get your shit. We're going to my room. Honey? I just found a chain of islands that we can sail to after New Zealand. That's wonderful. You know, I've been meaning to ask you... Why is it that Dale never left? Well, Dale has always coasted off my accomplishments. I mean, he left college his junior year... ...because he said he wanted to join the family business. - But you're a medical doctor. - Believe me, I've told him that. But he just always says, \"It's all about who you know.\" I don't know where he got this sense of entitlement. Maybe it was his mother passing."

Please, stop calling me Mr. Doback. Sorry. Okay. Mom, Doback... ...we think it would be very prudent... - Can we turn our beds into bunk beds? - Yes. Why are you guys so sweaty? We've already figured out how. The beds match up perfectly. It would give us so much extra space in our room to do activities. Please say yes. You don't need our permission to build bunk beds.

Welcome to the neighborhood! - My name is Craig. - The neighbor is a Nazi? You guys ever need fertilizer, I've got a lot of it. Close to 80 tons. Hey, folks! How you doing? You're gonna love this neighborhood. Every single house here recycles. - Okay, we're done here. - Yeah, okay. Hey, Derek, sprechen sie dick. Dale, I don't know how much you know about therapy... ...but it usually starts by you telling me something about yourself. I work at a college as a janitor... ...even though I'm smarter than most of the people there. Sometimes I see an equation written on a blackboard... ...like half an equation, and I'll just figure it out. - Is this Good Will Hunting? - No. It sounds a lot like the plot of Good Will Hunting. Yeah. Anyway. My best friend is Ben Affleck... So I thought we'd begin talking about your parents' divorce. Okay. How old were you when they got divorced? - Fifteen. - That's a hard age. - Yes. Yeah. - Do you wanna talk... ...about some of those feelings? - I love you. - Obviously, you don't know me. - I love you so much. Thank you. And I will take that as a feeling that you have... ...of comfortability with me. It's more than comfortability. - I mean, I fucking love you. - Okay. I th...

In no way, shape or form do I feel any feelings of intimacy towards you... ...in any way whatsoever. You got a really dope front lawn here. You and your homeboys can play on that. - You can just say \"It looks good.\" - Yeah. No, that's how I talk. Oh, you got a really fresh entryway here. Pretty awesome. - show you the front of the house, which is actual... Will you vultures please give us some privacy? He just died last night. What is going on here? It was the asbestos in here, that's what did it! I've seen too many dead bodies. - I can't be in here. I can't. - No, no, no. - Not bad. - Eat shit, Derek. - Awesome B-day party, broheisens. - You the man, Derek. Okay, who's this from? TJ? Where are the rest of my gifts, dude?"

Brennan, I'm alive. - You're waking the neighbors! - Shut up! - No. No. - Now I'm gonna play your drum set. - Help me. Close your eyes. Let the dirt just shower over you. This is your fault.

Give Ken-Doll Crotch here two weeks, tops. Dr. Angel Face, I just wanted to say thank you... ...for meeting me on such short notice. - Don't call me Angel Face. - I apologize. I'm very alone right now, and the thing I wanna ask you to help me... To show me how I can be a grown-up. Do I carry my high-school diploma around? What do you do with your hair? What happens if there's inclement weather? Where do you...? What do you wear? Can you wash clothes in the dishwasher? I notice that there's a long gap in your job history... ...and it said for 22 years... ...you went Kerouac on everyone's ass? I'm gonna be honest with you. I really need a job. And I will take any position, as long as it doesn't involve... ...having sex with old ladies for money or bear traps. - Those are my two bugaboos. - All right, got it. There's a catering business, there's a temp job open. And you get to play with fire. What do you want? This is my online-poker time. I'm ready to take on the Catalina Wine Mixer.",

So this isn't even a judgment call, man. - You're Audi 5000, my friend. - Derek, can't we talk about this? No. - Hey. - Shit. - Is everything okay? - No. He just fired me. What happened to the music? The band left. The guy freaked out. Derek fired me. - It's no big deal. - Robert, you don't get it. It's the Catalina Wine Mixer! People have killed to be in the position I'm in. - He's right. It's a big deal. - Here's a thought: I see an empty stage. I see drums, I see a drummer. I see a microphone, and I see a singer. - Dad, come on. - What? - We gave that stuff up. - We don't do that. Listen to me. Dale, look, when I was a kid... ...when I was a little boy, I always wanted to be a dinosaur. I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus rex more than anything. I made my arms short and I roamed the backyard... ...and I chased the neighborhood cats, and I growled and I roared. Everybody knew me and was afraid of me.

I didn't do it, I never did it. - Then I owe you an apology. - No. No, you don't, at all. No. Why wouldn't you take an apology if you didn't do it? Just because I'm cool. It doesn't matter. You got my passport. I'm good. Don't worry, not gonna be late. Don't worry. Corrected and re-synced to the last millisecond by Ashish Thakur."
