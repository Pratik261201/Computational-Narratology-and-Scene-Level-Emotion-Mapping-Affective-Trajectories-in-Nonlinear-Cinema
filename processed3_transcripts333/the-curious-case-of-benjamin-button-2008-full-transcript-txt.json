      "raw_text": "...and I'll tell you what, the storm system's still moving west. What are you looking at, Caroline? The wind, Mom. They say the hurricane is coming. I'm on a boat. I'm drifting. Can I do anything for you, Mom? Make anything easier? Oh, sugar... There's nothing left to do. Is what it is. Finding it harder to keep my eyes open. My mouth's full of cotton. There, there, Miss Daisy. You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons. Do you want any more medication, Mother? Doctor said you could have as much as you want. No need for anybody to suffer. A friend told me that she never had the chance to say goodbye to her mother. - I wanted to... - It's okay. I wanted to tell you how much I'm gonna miss you so... Mom. Oh, Caroline. Are you afraid? I'm curious. What comes next? They built the train station in 1918. My father was there the day it opened. He said they had a tuba band playing. They had the finest clockmaker in all of the South to build that glorious clock. His name was... Mr. Gateau. Mr. Cake. He was married to a Creole of Evangeline Parish and they had a son. Mr. Gateau was, from birth, absolutely blind. When their son was old enough, he joined the army. And they prayed God would keep him out of harm's way. For months, he did nothing but work on that clock. One day, a letter came. And Mr. Gateau, done for the night, went up, alone, to bed. And their son came home. They buried him in the family plot, where he would be with them when their time came. Mr. Cake worked on his clock, laboring to finish. It was a morning to remember. Papa said there were people everywhere. Even Teddy Roosevelt came. It's running backwards! I made it that way so that perhaps the boys that we lost in the war might stand and come home again. Home to farm, work, have children. To live long, full lives. Perhaps my own son might come home again. I'm sorry if I've offended anybody. I hope you enjoy my clock. Mr. Cake was never seen again. Some say he died of a broken heart. Some say he went to sea. Excuse me. Do you mind if I make a call? Somebody's watching my little boy. Sure. I hope I haven't disappointed you. You couldn't disappoint me. Well, I know I don't have much to show for myself. Find my dark suitcase. There's a diary. This? Could you read it to me? Is this what you want to do?",

Could you come downstairs? Never seen anything like it. Nearly blind from cataracts. I'm not sure if he can hear. His bones indicate severe arthritis. His skin has lost all elasticity, and his hands and feet are ossified. He shows all the deterioration, the infirmities, not of a newborn, but of a man well in his 80s on his way to the grave. He's dying? His body is failing him before his life's begun. Where'd he come from? My sister's child. From Lafayette. She had an unfortunate adventure. The poor child, he got the worst of it. Come out white. There are places for unwanted babies like these, Queenie. No room for another mouth to feed here. The Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions, thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is. - A baby... - You said he don't have long. - A baby... - You said he don't have long.

He's not a well child, so we're gonna have to take good care of him. I had 10 children. There's not a baby I can't care for. Let me see him. God in Heaven. He looks just like my ex-husband.

Mr. Weathers, come back here. Please. You never know what's coming for you. It seemed I had found a home. Is any of this true? You have such a lovely voice. Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token. That clock just kept going, year after year after year. But I didn't know I was a child. Same old crap every day. I thought I was like everyone else there. An old man in the twilight of his life. Could you make him stop that? Stop banging that fork. It's used for eating, not for playing with. And use your napkin, please, Mr. Benjamin. Queenie! Hey, boy. Always had a healthy curiosity. What was up the street? Or around the next corner? Go get him! Benjamin! That is dangerous. Come back over here. Stay put, child. I loved her very much. She was my mother. Mama. Mama. Some days I feel different than the day before. Everybody feels different about themselves, one way or another. But we're all going the same way. Just taking different roads to get there, that's all. You're on your own road, Benjamin. Mama? How much longer I got? Just be thankful for what you're given, hear? You're already here longer than you're supposed to. Some nights, I'd have to sleep alone. I didn't mind. I would listen to the house breathing. All those people sleeping. I felt safe. It was a place of great routine. Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather, General Winslow, U.S. Army, Retired, would raise the flag. Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once an opera singer of some note, well, she sang Wagner. All right, baby, come on. We got to put some life into these old sticks for you. Get you walking so you can help me out around here. Come on now, hear? No matter the season, supper was served promptly at 5:30. Molasses. Molasses. Molasses. I learned to read when I was five. My grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor. He brung home every play for me to read. \"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,\" \"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.\" \"Even like a man new haled from the rack,\" \"So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.\" \"And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death,\" \"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.\" You thought I was plain ignorant, didn't you?",

Could you make him stop that? Stop banging that fork. It's used for eating, not for playing with. And use your napkin, please, Mr. Benjamin. Queenie! Hey, boy. Always had a healthy curiosity. What was up the street? Or around the next corner? Go get him! Benjamin! That is dangerous. Come back over here. Stay put, child. I loved her very much. She was my mother. Mama. Mama. Some days I feel different than the day before. Everybody feels different about themselves, one way or another. But we're all going the same way. Just taking different roads to get there, that's all. You're on your own road, Benjamin. Mama? How much longer I got? Just be thankful for what you're given, hear? You're already here longer than you're supposed to. Some nights, I'd have to sleep alone. I didn't mind. I would listen to the house breathing. All those people sleeping. I felt safe. It was a place of great routine. Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather, General Winslow, U.S. Army, Retired, would raise the flag. Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once an opera singer of some note, well, she sang Wagner. All right, baby, come on. We got to put some life into these old sticks for you. Get you walking so you can help me out around here. Come on now, hear? No matter the season, supper was served promptly at 5:30. Molasses. Molasses. Molasses. I learned to read when I was five. My grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor. He brung home every play for me to read. \"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,\" \"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.\" \"Even like a man new haled from the rack,\" \"So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.\" \"And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death,\" \"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.\" You thought I was plain ignorant, didn't you?"

So, what line of work do you do? I'm a tugboat man. I enjoyed talking to you. I enjoyed drinking with you. Benjamin? Would you mind if, time to time, I stopped by and said hello? Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button. Good night, Benjamin. Drive on. Where have you been? Nothing. I met some people and listened to some music. Oh, sweet Jesus, boy! Growing up's a funny thing. Sneaks up on you.

Sunday? Do you know what that means? Means I was very drunk last night. Well, you're drunk every night. - Is that a girl? - Close friend. I want to show her the river. You're not supposed to go joyriding with civilians. I could lose my license. What are you waiting for? Pulled in for repair a wounded duck. She's flying now, huh? Ahoy, sailor! I wish we could go with them. Did you say something, Mom? It's getting really bad. Can you hear me, Mom? Time just seeped out of me. \"Things were changing quickly.\" I don't know how it's possible, but you seem to have more hair. What if I told you that I wasn't getting older, but I was getting younger than everybody else? Well, I'd feel sorry for you, to have to see everybody you love die before you do. It's an awful responsibility. I'd never thought about life or death that way before. Benjamin, we're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us? And one fall day, a familiar visitor came knocking on our door. You want to go with me to the drugstore?",

Steady on! When I couldn't go any further, I stopped. I just stopped. And everybody asked me, would I try again? For why wouldn't I? But I never did.

Don't waste any time bothering about the wine or the cheese in Murmansk, 'cause they're really completely ordinary, but the caviar and the vodka are sublime and plentiful. So. Savor it. And don't eat it all at once, because that way, there's nothing left to enjoy. And now, take a little swallow of vodka while it's still in your mouth. You haven't been with many women, have you? Not on Sundays. And you've never had caviar before, have you? No, ma'am. When I was 19, I attempted to become the first woman ever to swim the English Channel. Really? But the current that day was so strong that, for every stroke I took, I was pushed back two. I was in the water for 32 hours. And when I was two miles from Calais, it started to rain. That's it! Steady on! When I couldn't go any further, I stopped. I just stopped. And everybody asked me, would I try again? For why wouldn't I? But I never did. As a matter of fact, I've never done anything with my life after that. Your hands are so coarse. I can feel the wind in your cheek. I'm afraid it's the witching hour."

Thank you. That's very kind of you to say. I better get changed. A group of us are going to a party. - Would you want to come? - Someone told me about a restaurant I thought you might enjoy. I made a reservation, just in case. Just, all the dancers go out after the show. You're... You're welcome to come with us. I'll get changed. All right? She choreographs for the Ballets Russes. She's divine. You were breathtaking. Sweetie. This is David. He dances with the company. - This is Benjamin. - Who? - I told you about him. - Oh, yeah. How you doing? - I'll go get you a drink. - All right. Thanks. So, you were a friend of her grandmother's? Or something like that? Something like that. Hey, excuse me. Come on. Hey!

Oh, well, I wish you would've called. You took me by surprise. - You can just throw them out. - No. Thank you, they're lovely. I couldn't take my eyes off of you. I thought you were mesmerizing. Thank you. That's very kind of you to say. I better get changed. A group of us are going to a party. - Would you want to come? - Someone told me about a restaurant I thought you might enjoy. I made a reservation, just in case. Just, all the dancers go out after the show. You're... You're welcome to come with us. I'll get changed. All right? She choreographs for the Ballets Russes. She's divine. You were breathtaking. Sweetie. This is David. He dances with the company. - This is Benjamin. - Who? - I told you about him. - Oh, yeah. How you doing? - I'll go get you a drink. - All right. Thanks. So, you were a friend of her grandmother's? Or something like that? Something like that. Hey, excuse me. Come on. Hey!

Good night, Benjamin. Good night, Daisy. And as I knew I would, I watched her go. That's the last thing he wrote. Sometime after your father passed, there was a call. Hello. Yes, speaking. I'm sorry, I don't understand. It's the corner house. Come on in. - I'm Daisy Fuller. - I'm David Hernandez, with the Orleans Parish Department of Child Welfare Services. He was living in a condemned building. The police found this with him. This address. It's got your name in it a lot. He's in very poor health. He was taken to the hospital. He doesn't seem to know who or where he is. He's very confused. I was telling Mr. Hernandez that Benjamin is one of us. If he needs a place to stay, it's all right, he can stay here. Benjamin? You play beautifully. He doesn't seem to like to be touched. He goes in and out of states of recognition. The doctors say, if they didn't know any better, he has the beginnings of dementia. Do you remember me? I'm Daisy. I'm Benjamin. It's nice to meet you, Benjamin. Would you mind if I sit with you? I would love to hear you play. Do I know you? - I want some breakfast. - And every day, I would stop by to make sure that he was comfortable. - No, I didn't. - You just finished eating. Don't think I don't know what you're doing! You're all fucking liars! He doesn't believe he just had his breakfast. He doesn't believe he just had his breakfast. Now, why don't we see if we can't find something else for you to do? I have a feeling there's a lot of things I can't remember. Well, like what, sugar? It's like there's this whole life I had, and I can't remember what it was. It's okay. It's okay to forget things. Many times, he would simply forget who or where he was. There he is, he's up there on the roof. It wasn't easy. - Benjamin! - I can see everything! - I can see the big river! - That's right, you can see everything, sweetheart. I can see the graveyard where Mama's buried, - and all those other people. - I want you to come down!",
