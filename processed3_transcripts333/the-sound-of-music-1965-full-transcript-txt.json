I just couldn't help myself. The gates were open, and the hills were beckoning, and before I- Dear, I haven't summoned you here for apologies. Oh, please, Mother, do let me ask for forgiveness. If it would make you feel better. Yes. Well, you see, the sky was so blue today... and everything was so green and fragrant. I just had to be a part of it. And the Untersberg kept leading me higher and higher... as though it wanted me to go right through the clouds with it. Child, suppose darkness had come and you were lost? Oh, Mother, I could never be lost up there. That's my mountain. I was brought up on it. It was the mountain that led me to you. Oh? When I was a child, I would come down the mountain... and climb a tree and look over into your garden. I'd see the sisters at work, and I'd hear them sing on their way to vespers... which brings me to another transgression, Reverend Mother. I was singing out there today without permission. Maria, it is only here in the abbey that we have rules about postulants singing. I can't seem to stop singing wherever I am. And what's worse, I can't seem to stop saying things- everything and anything I think and feel. Some people would call that honesty. But it's terrible, Reverend Mother. You know how Sister Berthe always makes me kiss the floor after we've had a disagreement? Lately I've taken to kissing the floor when I see her coming just to save time. Maria, when you saw us over the abbey wall... and longed to be one of us... that didn't necessarily mean... that you were prepared for the way we live here, did it? No, Mother, but I- I pray, and I try... and I am learning, I really am. What is the most important lesson you have learned here, my child? To find out what is the will of God and to do it wholeheartedly. Maria. It seems to be the will of God that you leave us. - Leave? - Only for a while, Maria. Oh, no, Mother, please don't do that. Don't send me away. This is where I belong. It’s my home, my family. It’s my life. - But are you truly ready for it? - Yes, I am. Perhaps if you go out into the world for a time... knowing what we expect of you... you will have a chance to find out if you can expect it of yourself. I know what you expect, Mother, and I can do it. - I promise I can. - Maria. Yes, Mother. If it is God's will. There is a family near Salzburg... that needs a governess until September. - Until September? - To take care of seven children. - Seven children! - Do you like children, Maria? Well, yes, but seven! I will tell Captain von Trapp to expect you tomorrow. Uh, Captain? A retired officer of the Imperial Navy. A fine man and a brave one. Ηis wife died several years ago, leaving him alone with the children. I understand he's had a most difficult time... managing to keep a governess there. Uh, why difficult, Reverend Mother? The Lord will show you in his own good time.",

It’s very kind of you to offer to help me, Baroness. I'm delighted, Maria. I really don't think I do have anything that would be appropriate. Now, where is that lovely little thing... you were wearing the other evening... when the captain couldn't keep his eyes off you? Couldn't keep his eyes off me? Come, my dear, we are women. Let's not pretend we don't know when a man notices us. - Here we are. - The captain notices everybody and everything. There's no need to feel so defensive, Maria. You are quite attractive, you know. The captain would hardly be a man if he didn't notice you. Baroness, I hope you're joking. - Not at all. - But I've never done a thing to- But you don't have to, my dear. There's nothing more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him. - In love with him? - Of course. But what makes it so nice is he thinks he's in love with you. But that's not true. Surely you've noticed the way he looks into your eyes. And, you know, uh, you blushed in his arms... when you were dancing just now. Don't take it to heart. He'll get over it soon enough, I should think. Men do, you know. Then I should go. I mustn't stay here. - Is there something I can do to help? - No, nothing. Yes. Please don't say a word about this to the captain. No. No, I wouldn't dream of it. Good-bye, Maria. I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun. Champagne, darling. I feel like celebrating. Cheers. - You know something? - Perhaps. Then if you're so clever, tell me how to get our little fraülein... to use her influence with Georg. I want those children in the festival.

Oh, come, now, Baron, would you have us believe... that Austria alone holds a monopoly on virtue? Herr Zeller, some of us prefer Austrian voices raised in song... to ugly German threats. The ostrich buries his head in the sand... and sometimes... in the flag. Perhaps those who would warn you that the Anschluss is coming- and it is coming, Captain- perhaps they would get further with you... by setting their words to music. If the Nazis take over Austria, I have no doubt that you will be the entire trumpet section. - You flatter me, Captain. - Oh, how clumsy of me. I meant to accuse you. It’s very kind of you to offer to help me, Baroness. I'm delighted, Maria. I really don't think I do have anything that would be appropriate. Now, where is that lovely little thing... you were wearing the other evening... when the captain couldn't keep his eyes off you? Couldn't keep his eyes off me? Come, my dear, we are women. Let's not pretend we don't know when a man notices us. - Here we are. - The captain notices everybody and everything. There's no need to feel so defensive, Maria. You are quite attractive, you know. The captain would hardly be a man if he didn't notice you. Baroness, I hope you're joking. - Not at all. - But I've never done a thing to- But you don't have to, my dear. There's nothing more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him. - In love with him? - Of course. But what makes it so nice is he thinks he's in love with you. But that's not true. Surely you've noticed the way he looks into your eyes. And, you know, uh, you blushed in his arms... when you were dancing just now. Don't take it to heart. He'll get over it soon enough, I should think. Men do, you know. Then I should go. I mustn't stay here. - Is there something I can do to help? - No, nothing. Yes. Please don't say a word about this to the captain. No. No, I wouldn't dream of it. Good-bye, Maria. I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun. Champagne, darling. I feel like celebrating. Cheers. - You know something? - Perhaps. Then if you're so clever, tell me how to get our little fraülein... to use her influence with Georg. I want those children in the festival. Elsa, this is important to Austria. It wouldn't do you any harm either. I've thought of that. Well, if it's a matter of influence... maybe the one you'll have to be talking to is me. ♪♪",

Maria, the love of a man and a woman is holy too. You have a great capacity to love. What you must find out is how God wants you to spend your love. But I've pledged my life to God. I- I've pledged my life to his service. My daughter, if you love this man, it doesn't mean you love God less. No. You must find out. You must go back. Mother, you can't ask me to do that.

If the children don't sing at the festival, well, it will be a reflection on Austria. Oh, I know. It wouldn't do me any good either. - Mother? - Hmm? - That sounds so nice. I like calling you mother. - I like hearing it. - You love Father very much. I can tell you do. - Very much. Mother, what do you do when you think you love someone- I mean, when you stop loving someone... or he stops loving you? Well, you cry a little. And then you wait for the sun to come out. It always does. There are so many things I think I should know, but I don't. - I really don't. - How can you? Sometimes I feel the world is coming to an end. And then you feel it's just beginning? - Yes. - It was that way with me, Liesl. And for you, it will be just as wonderful, I promise.

Well, apparently, we're both suffering from a deplorable lack of curiosity. You were sent a telegram, which you did not answer. A telegram from Admiral von Schreiber of the navy of the Third Reich. I was under the impression, Herr Zeller... that the contents of telegrams in Austria are private! At least the Austria I know. I have my orders. And they are to take you personally to Bremerhaven tonight... where you will accept your commission. I'm afraid that's going to be quite impossible.

You were sent a telegram, which you did not answer. A telegram from Admiral von Schreiber of the navy of the Third Reich. I was under the impression, Herr Zeller... that the contents of telegrams in Austria are private! At least the Austria I know. I have my orders.
