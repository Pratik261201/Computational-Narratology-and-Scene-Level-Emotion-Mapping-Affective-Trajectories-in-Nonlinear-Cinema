      "raw_text": "Movietown News presents Spotlight on Adventure. What you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity, a lost world in South America. Lurking in the shadow of majestic Paradise Falls, it sports plants and animals undiscovered by science. Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit? Why, our subject today, Charles Muntz! The beloved explorer lands his dirigible the Spirit of Adventure, in New Hampshire this week, completing a yearlong expedition to the lost world. This lighter-than-air craft was designed by Muntz himself and is longer than 22 prohibition paddy wagons placed end to end. And here comes the adventurer now. Never apart from his faithful dogs, Muntz conceived the craft for canine comfort. It's a veritable floating palace in the sky, complete with doggy bath and mechanical canine walker. And, Jiminy Cricket do the locals consider Muntz the bee's knees. And how! Adventure is out there! But what has Muntz brought back this time? Gentlemen, I give you the monster of Paradise Falls! And, golly, what a swell monster this is! But what's this? Scientists cry foul. The National Explorer's Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton. No! The organization strips Muntz of his membership. Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast alive! I promise to capture the beast alive, and I will not come back until I do! And so, the explorer's off to clear his name. Bon voyage, Charles Muntz, and good luck capturing the monster of Paradise Falls! Here's Charles Muntz piloting his famous dirigible. He hurdles Pikes Peak. He hurdles the Grand Canyon. He hurdles Mount Everest. He goes around Mount Everest. Is there nothing he cannot do? Yes, as Muntz himself says, \"Adventure is...\" Adventure is out there! Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard! Must get Spirit of Adventure over Mount Rushmore! Hold together, old girl. How're my dogs doing? All engines, ahead full! Let's take her up to 26,000 feet. Rudders 18 degrees towards the south. It's a beautiful day. Winds out of the east at 10 knots. Visibility unlimited. Enter the weather in the logbook. Oh! There's something down there. I will bring it back for science. Aw! It's a puppy! Ah! No time! A storm!",

Does it really work? Kid, would you stop with the... - This makes it go right. - Let go of that... - And that way's left. - Knock it off! Hey, look! Buildings. That building's so close I could almost touch it. Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen. Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! Hey! I can see your house from here. Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa! Well, that's not gonna work. I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus. Did you know that the cumulonimbus forms when warm air rises over cool air? Stayed up all night blowing up balloons... for what? And that's how we get lightning. - That's nice, kid. - Mr. Fredricksen? There's a storm coming. It's starting to get scary. We're gonna get blown to bits! We're in big trouble... - What are you doing over there? - Look. See? Cumulonimbus. My pack! Got ya! I thought you were dead. What happened? I steered us. I did. I steered the house. Steered us? After you tied your stuff down, you took a nap. So I went ahead and steered us down here. Yeah. Sure. Can't tell where we are. Oh, we're in South America, all right. It was a cinch with my Wilderness Explorer GPS. - GP... What? - My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we'll never be lost! Oops. We'll get you down, find a bus stop, you just tell the man you wanna go back to your mother. Sure, but I don't think they have buses in Paradise Falls. There.",

We're on our way, Ellie. Huh? Hmm. Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell. What are you doing out here, kid? I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse. Please let me in. No. Oh, alright, you can come... Huh. I've never been in a floating house before. Goggles. Look at this stuff. Wow! You're going on a trip? \"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time.\" You're going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? Don't touch that! You'll soil it. You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you will have all your TV and clocks and stuff. Whoa. Is this how you steer your house? Does it really work? Kid, would you stop with the... - This makes it go right. - Let go of that... - And that way's left. - Knock it off! Hey, look! Buildings. That building's so close I could almost touch it. Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen. Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! Hey! I can see your house from here. Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa! Well, that's not gonna work. I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus. Did you know that the cumulonimbus forms when warm air rises over cool air? Stayed up all night blowing up balloons... for what? And that's how we get lightning. - That's nice, kid. - Mr. Fredricksen? There's a storm coming. It's starting to get scary. We're gonna get blown to bits! We're in big trouble... - What are you doing over there? - Look. See? Cumulonimbus. My pack! Got ya! I thought you were dead. What happened? I steered us. I did. I steered the house. Steered us? After you tied your stuff down, you took a nap. So I went ahead and steered us down here. Yeah. Sure. Can't tell where we are. Oh, we're in South America, all right. It was a cinch with my Wilderness Explorer GPS. - GP... What? - My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we'll never be lost! Oops. We'll get you down, find a bus stop, you just tell the man you wanna go back to your mother. Sure, but I don't think they have buses in Paradise Falls. There."

Yeah, your voice sounds funny! Beta! Gamma! Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel! Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning. No, no, no. But maybe Dug would. You might wanna ask him. Yeah. I wonder if he's found the bird on his very special mission. Do not mention Dug to me at this time. His fool's errand will keep him most occupied. Most occupied indeed. Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now? Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat. You are wise, my trusted lieutenant. This is Alpha calling Dug. Come in, Dug. Hi, Alpha. Hey, your voice sounds funny. I know, I know! Have you seen the bird?"

How? - She likes chocolate. - Chocolate? Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes gaga for it. But it ran off. It's gone now. You know, Carl, these people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories. A surveyor making a map. A botanist cataloguing plants. An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls. I mean, that's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends. Well, it's been a wonderful evening, but we better be going. Oh, you're not leaving. We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. - Come on, Russell. - But we haven't even had dessert yet. The boy's right. You haven't had dessert.

Hang on to Kevin! Kevin. Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down. She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home? All right, but we gotta hurry. You lost them? No, it was Dug. Yeah. He's with them. He helped them escape! Wait. Wait a minute. Dug. See anything? No. My pack is not following us. Boy, they are dumb. This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero, and he's trying to kill us. What a joke! Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel walks up to a tree and says, \"I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead.\" Ha! It is funny because the squirrel gets dead. Careful, Russell. You okay, Kevin? You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn't quite what I expected. Yeah? How so? It's kind of wild. I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book. Get used to that, kid. My dad made it sound so easy. He's really good at camping and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to come to all my Sweat Lodge meetings.
