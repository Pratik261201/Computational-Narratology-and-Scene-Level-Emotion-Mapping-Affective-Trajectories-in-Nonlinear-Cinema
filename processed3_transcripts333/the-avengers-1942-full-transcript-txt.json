He's used to finding out things -and mixing with people. -Metcalfe's never mixed with anything but horses. Send him to Norway, an he'll start steeple chasing with sea lions. Metcalfe's a typical product of a good-for-nothing minor aristocracy run to see. All the more reason to give him a chance to strike new rules.

As you say, Danzig is only a small place. So was Thermopylae, and Verdun. And Madrid. All there's, small places. Big enough to bitter the people that hadn't the guts to fight for them. Did you ever hear Hitler laugh? I did. I was in Vienna. When he entered the city in triumph. \"Providence has sent me here to save you.\" He bellowed to the model of his followers. \"And I have only helped all those that had been against me.\" Then he laughed. It's a kind of mad laugh! And they all laughed too, in the same way. \"You are bane for blood!\" Hitler was giving it to them. We are in this for our own sweet selves. If we want to save our skins, we've got to fight. That's a good article in there, Frank. Ha! It'll cost you nine pounds a word to use it! I never pay more than seven pounds. Well, good night, sir.

Hi, Mr. Metcalfe. May I introduce you to the crew, sir. Yes. I wish you wouldn't call me \"sir\". I would have called you sir. And any other captain of the aircraft. Do you hear that, boys? That's proper respect for you. -Let it be a lesson to you. -Yes, sir. Anything you say, sir. Jolly good show, sir. I have a very disrespectful crew. So I see. Mr. Metcalfe is a very distinguished journalist and what's more, he's going on a one-way trip. Ok, sir. We'll look after him alright. Are you the bloke that tipped Taj Mahal at the derby? -Hmm. -Glad to meet you, sir. I backed it half a crown each way! I hope you remember to make him sign of bloodshed, sir."
