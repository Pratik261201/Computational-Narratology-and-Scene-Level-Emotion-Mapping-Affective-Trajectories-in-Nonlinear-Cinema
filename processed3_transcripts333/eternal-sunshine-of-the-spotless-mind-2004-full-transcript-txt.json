I ditched work today. Took a train out to Montauk. Montauk train boarding on track B. I don't know why. I'm not an impulsive person. I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning. I gotta get my car fixed. Hi. Cindy? It's Joel. Joel! Listen, I don't feel very well today. No, food poisoning, I think. It's goddamn freezing on this beach. Montauk in February. Brilliant, Joel. Page is ripped out. Don't remember doing that. It appears this is my first entry in two years. Sand is overrated. It's just tiny little rocks. If only I could meet someone new. I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished, seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know. Maybe I should get back together with Naomi. She was nice. Nice is good. She loved me. Why do I fall in love with every woman I see... who shows me the least bit of attention? Hi. I'm sorry? - I just said hi. - Hi. Hello. Hi. Okay if I sit closer? How far are you going? Uh, Rockville Center. Get out! Me too! - Really? - What are the odds? Do I know you? Do you ever shop at Barnes & Noble? - Sure. Sure. - That's it! - Yeah? - I've seen you, man! Book slave there for, like, five years now. - Ah. I would have thought I would've remembered you. - Jesus! Is it five years? It might be the hair. - What might? - It changes a lot. The color. That's why you might not recognize me. - It's called Blue Ruin, the color. - Right. Yeah. - Snappy name, huh? - I like it. Yeah. Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red... Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. You think there could possibly be a job like that? I mean, how many hair colors could there be? Fifty, maybe. Someone's got that job. Agent Orange! I came up with that one. I apply my personality in a paste. Oh, I doubt that very much. Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you? Sorry. I was just... I'm trying to be nice. Yeah. I got it. - My name's Clementine, by the way. - I'm Joel. - Hi, Joel. - Hey. No jokes about my name. Oh, no, you wouldn't do that. You're trying to be nice.",

Patrick! Baby boy. - What you doing here, baby? - Just came to surprise you. - Let me know if you need something, sir. - You look good. Hi. - How are you? - Pretty good. Pretty bored. Pretty tired. Uh-huh. - I so want what's in your suit. - Oh, good. Why? Why would she do that to me? Hey, does anybody want a joint? Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest. Oh, God. She's punishing me. - I know, honey. - For being honest. - It's horrible. - I should just go to her house. No! No, no, no. You don't wanna go there, man. You don't wanna go there. Get off. It's too... - Right. - Yeah. I don't want to seem desperate. Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break. Right? Right? All right, Joel, look, man, seriously. - Rob! - Here's the deal. Don't do that. Rob, what are you doing? No, no, no, no. What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?

I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will. There's a good story behind this one... Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items. Just try to focus on the memories. Oh. Sorry. Okay. Healthy activity up there again. Healthy readouts. Very good. - Here's another object. - That's so... Next item. Okay. Potato head. Next item. Okay. Just focus on the memories. Patrick, do me a favor. - Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya? - Yeah. Can you check the voltage regulator? What do we got there? - Uh, voltage looks fine. - Really? Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here. I'm... Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage. Check the, uh... Check the connections, please. Oh, there you are. I... Why am I... I don't understand what I'm looking at. Why am I standing here and... Oh, my God. D?j? vu. D?j? vu. This is so... All right, we should get started. If we're gonna get the procedure... underway tonight, we have some work to do. I'm in my head already, aren't I? I suppose so. Uh, this is about right. This is what it... This is what it would look like. Very good. We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here. That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home. Ah, there we go. - Patrick? - Yeah? - Patrick, can you check... - Patrick? - I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice. - Patrick? Patrick? - Why are there so many wires? - A lot of equipment. - Does that help? - Are you sure you set that thing up properly? - How's that? - How are you today, Mr. Barish? - There we are, Mr. Barish. - That's better. - I don't know if I like this. - Think I might try this, then. We're almost done now. Mmm. Journal. That would be invaluable. \"I met someone tonight. I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing.\" Whoa! Jesus! - What? What? - Come on! Careful! Step back! Just take it easy. That's fine. Let's not roach the guy. All right, you got that one. - This place is sort of a dump, don't you think? - It's an apartment, Patrick. Patrick. Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain."
