I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand. And didn't try to sleep with that person at that party... even though you could have. Please, don't try to figure out who I am. I don't want you to do that. I just need to know that people like you exist. Like, if you met me you wouldn't... think I was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you nervous. I hope it's okay for me to think that. You see, I haven't really talked to anyone... outside of my family all summer. But tomorrow is my first day of high school ever. And I need to turn things around. So I have a plan. As I enter the school for the first time... I will visualize what it will be like... on the last day of my senior year. Unfortunately, I counted and that's... Hop, freshman toads! Hop! Let's move it! 1,385 days from now. We worked out all summer. Rock hard. Hey, you know what? Why don't you guys get a room? Just 1,385 days. In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister, Candace, and her boyfriend, Derek... would have let me eat lunch with their Earth Club. Seniors only. What are you doing with that plastic fork? I don't wanna bring back silverware. Derek, you're Earth Club treasurer. Come on! When my sister said \"No,\" I thought... maybe my old friend Susan would wanna have lunch with me. In middle school, Susan was very fun to be around... but now she doesn't like to say \"Hi\" to me any more. And then there's Brad Hays. Before my older brother went to play football for Penn State... he and Brad played together... so I thought maybe he'd say \"Hi\" to me. But Brad's a senior. And I'm me. So who am I kidding? On the bright side... one senior decided to make fun of the teacher instead of the freshmen. He even drew on Mr. Callahan's legendary goatee... with a grease pencil. The prick punch is not a toy.",

Look, my name is Patrick. Either you call me Patrick or you call me nothing. Okay, Nothing. I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't doing the impersonation to be mean or anything. He was just trying to make us freshmen feel better. Nothing, why don't you read first? All right. \"Chapter One.\" Surviving your fascist shop teacher... \"who needs to put kids down to feel big.\" Wow, this is useful, guys. We should read on. My last class of the day is Advanced English... and I'm really excited to finally learn... with the smartest kids in the school. Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot. Believe it or not, she's gotten straight A's since kindergarten. Shh! I'm Mr. Anderson. I'm gonna be your teacher for freshman English. This semester we're gonna learn about... Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Genius book. Now, who'd like to get out of the first pop quiz? I'm shocked. All right. Well, you can skip the quiz... if you tell me which author invented the paperback book. Anyone? He was British. He also invented the serial. In fact, at the end of the third chapter of his first novel... he had a man hanging from a cliff by his fingernails. Hence the term \"cliff hanger.\" Anybody? - Yeah? - Shakespeare. That's a great guess, but no. Shakespeare didn't write novels. Anybody else? The author... was Charles Dickens. However, if you and I had gone to a Shakespeare play... it would have cost us four pennies. Can you imagine that? We would have put those pennies in a metal box. The ushers would lock it in the office. And that's where we get the term... Cash register. Office Max. I'll give you a free \"A\" on anything... except the final term paper if you get it right. Box office. You should learn to participate. Why didn't you raise your hand? They call you the \"teacher's pet\"? \"Freak\"? That kinda thing? I used to get \"spaz.\" I mean, come on, \"spaz\"?

All right. We're goin' to Kings after the game if you wanna come. Do you have a favourite band? Well, I think The Smiths are my favourite. Are you kidding? I love The Smiths. Best breakup band ever. What's your favourite song? \"Asleep.\" It's from Louder than Bombs. I heard it on Ponytail Derek's mix tape. That works on so many levels. I can make you guys a copy if you want. - What about Eides? You love Eides, right? - Yeah, of course. They're great. Not a band, Charlie. It's a record store down town. Things sound so much better on vinyl. You know, I used to be popular before Sam got me some good music. So you be careful. She'll ruin your life forever. That's okay. - Hey, Nothing. - Hey, Nothing. Let it go! Jesus! It's an antique joke. It's over. So what are you gonna do when you get outta this place? Well, my Aunt Helen said I should be a writer... but I don't know what I'd write about. You could write about us. Yeah! Call it Slut and the Falcon. Make us solve crimes. You guys seem really happy together. How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend? He's not my boyfriend. He's my stepbrother. My mom finally left my worthless dad... and married his nice dad when we moved here. But she's not bitter or anything. Make no mistake. Absolutely not. Charlie, I'm not a bulimic. - I'm a bulim-ist. - I'm sorry, I don't know what that is. She just really believes in bulimia. I love bulimia! Hey. Thanks for paying, Charlie.",

Would you leave Ponytail Derek alone? You put the \"ass\" in \"class,\" Patrick. I try. Sam, I try. It's nice to meet you, Charlie. I'm Sam. What's the plan? Are we going to Mary Elizabeth's tonight? Nope. She got caught watering down her parents' brandy with iced tea. Let's just go to Kings. All right. We're goin' to Kings after the game if you wanna come. Do you have a favourite band? Well, I think The Smiths are my favourite. Are you kidding? I love The Smiths. Best breakup band ever. What's your favourite song? \"Asleep.\" It's from Louder than Bombs. I heard it on Ponytail Derek's mix tape. That works on so many levels. I can make you guys a copy if you want. - What about Eides? You love Eides, right? - Yeah, of course. They're great. Not a band, Charlie. It's a record store down town. Things sound so much better on vinyl. You know, I used to be popular before Sam got me some good music. So you be careful. She'll ruin your life forever. That's okay. - Hey, Nothing. - Hey, Nothing. Let it go! Jesus! It's an antique joke. It's over. So what are you gonna do when you get outta this place? Well, my Aunt Helen said I should be a writer... but I don't know what I'd write about. You could write about us. Yeah! Call it Slut and the Falcon. Make us solve crimes. You guys seem really happy together. How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend? He's not my boyfriend. He's my stepbrother. My mom finally left my worthless dad... and married his nice dad when we moved here. But she's not bitter or anything. Make no mistake. Absolutely not. Charlie, I'm not a bulimic. - I'm a bulim-ist. - I'm sorry, I don't know what that is. She just really believes in bulimia. I love bulimia! Hey. Thanks for paying, Charlie."

He even had a play put up in New York once... which I think is very impressive. Great Gatsby? He and his wife might go back there after this year. I know this is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't. My favourite time, though, is lunch... because I get to see Sam and Patrick. We spend the time working on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine... about music and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's called Punk Rocky. Mary Elizabeth is really interesting... because she's a Buddhist and a punk. But somehow she always acts like my father at the end of a long day. Her best friend Alice loves vampires... and wants to go to film school. She also steals jeans from the mall. I don't know why, because her family is rich... but I'm trying not to be judgemental. Especially since I know that they were all there for Patrick last year. Patrick never likes to be serious... so it took me a while to get what happened. When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I guess it was hard, too... because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around. Then Monday in school, Brad would say... \"Man, I was so wasted I don't remember a thing.\" This went on for seven months. When they finally did it, Brad said he loved Patrick. Then he started to cry. No matter what Patrick did... Brad kept saying that his dad would kill him. And saying that he was going to hell. Patrick was eventually able to help Brad get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt sad... that he still had to keep it a secret. And he said \"No,\" because at least now... Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him. I think I understand, because I really like Sam. I asked my sister about her... and she said that when Sam was a freshman... the upperclass men used to get her drunk at parties. I guess she had a reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate for her to judge me based on what I used to be like. So I've been making her a mix tape so she'll know how I feel. Shit! - C! - C! - Give me a K! - K! - Give me a Y! - Y! What's that spell? Rocky! I can't hear you! Rocky! One more time! Rocky! ♪ Whatever happened to Fay Wray?",

I probably should have been honest about... how I didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but... I really didn't want to hurt her feelings. You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice person... underneath the part of her that hates everyone. Hey! And since I heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy... I tried hard to love her like I love Sam. Can you believe it's almost our 2-week anniversary? Yeah, I know. So I took her on double dates. First foreign film. Do you want butter on your popcorn? Vegans don't eat butter. And I tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands... even when her hands are sweaty. And I had to admit something really upsetting, but... I'm tired of touching her boobs. I thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make-out music... once in a while, we might have a chance. And maybe if she didn't put down the books that Mr. Anderson gives me. Walden.

My dad collects wine, but he doesn't drink. That's kinda weird, isn't it? I guess. Where are your parents? Their club's hosting a cotillion or something racist. They'll be gone all night. Sure is a nice fire. Yeah. When I'm done being a lobbyist... I wanna move to a house like this in Cape Cod. Sounds nice, doesn't it? Yeah. Your heart is beating really fast. Is it? Here. Feel. Charlie? Do you like me? You know what I mean. I think so. Don't be nervous. Charlie. I didn't know how tonight was gonna go, but... It's really nice, isn't it? Yeah. I just can't believe it. You, of all people. I just can't believe you're my boyfriend. Shit! My parents! Shit! - Here, zip this up. - Okay. No, I got this. Just zip it up like a normal zipper! It's stuck. It's just... Thank you. See you Monday. Dear friend... sorry I haven't written for a while... but things are a total disaster. We're literally making out and I'm in my bra... Hello! And the front door opens, it's my parents! I probably should have been honest about... how I didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but... I really didn't want to hurt her feelings. You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice person... underneath the part of her that hates everyone. Hey! And since I heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy... I tried hard to love her like I love Sam. Can you believe it's almost our 2-week anniversary? Yeah, I know. So I took her on double dates. First foreign film. Do you want butter on your popcorn? Vegans don't eat butter. And I tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands... even when her hands are sweaty. And I had to admit something really upsetting, but... I'm tired of touching her boobs. I thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make-out music... once in a while, we might have a chance. And maybe if she didn't put down the books that Mr. Anderson gives me. Walden. I read this in 7th grade."

So I know it's none of my business, but have you decided? Are you going to New York? Well... My wife and I like it here. And I think I might be better at teaching than writing. You know, Charlie, I was thinking that... maybe I could still give you books next year. Yeah. Yeah. I think you could write one of them one day. - Really? - I do. You're the best teacher I've ever had. Thank you. 10, nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, two, one. Dear friend... I wanted to tell you about us running. There was this beautiful sunset.

Goddamn Penguins. Think they're allergic to goddamn defence. What do the players call a puck again? A biscuit. Are you sure it's not a \"goddamn biscuit\"? You're cruisin' for a bruisin'. Honey, I think we're gonna have to do... a little shopping for you before you take off? - Yeah, I need some books. - Clothes, too. Yeah. Can Charlie come out and play? The first night, we had grilled stickies. So good. You have to visit in the fall. We'll have some, okay? Definitely. Sorry... Charlie has a breakdown scheduled for October. Well, can I tell you something? I've been away for two months. It's another world. And it gets better. And my room mate Katie has the best taste in music. I found the tunnel song. Let's drive. I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters... because I might be too busy trying to participate. So, if this does end up being the last letter... I want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school. And you helped me. Even if you didn't know what I was talking about... or know someone who's gone through it. You made me not feel alone. Because I know there are people who say all these things don't happen. There are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17. I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now these moments are not stories. This is happening. I am here. And I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive. You stand up and see the lights on the buildings...",

        "My brother and sister always came for those... until Chris had to go to training camp. He's going to be first string this year. My sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job. Here he is. So I'll see you Thursday at 6:00, right? - Okay. - You gonna hang in there? My doctor said we can't choose where we come from... but we can choose where we go from there.
