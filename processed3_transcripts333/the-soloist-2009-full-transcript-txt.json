He says he wants to be here. He says this is his choice. Should I take him at his word, or should I try to force him inside? Wouldn't a little arm-twisting be more humane than leaving him here on the streets in this lost colony of broken, helpless souls? NATHANIEL: I hope you sleep well, Mr. Lopez.

Well, what's the date today? No, the Third Symphony. I'll cause a scene. I don't wanna cause a scene. I don't wanna stick out or anything like that. So it's just... It's impossible. It can't happen.
