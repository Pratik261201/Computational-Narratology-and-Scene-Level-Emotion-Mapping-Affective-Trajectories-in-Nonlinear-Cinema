Been trying to pin something to him but it doesn't work. Trust me. He's behind all of it. He runs everything out of his house down by the beach.

We're at the Vinyard home right now and Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son, Derek, has agreed to talk with us fro a moment. Derek, if you could come down here, please, for just a second. Look, I know this is tough but how do you feel right now? How do you think I feel? I think it's typical. Typical, how? While this country's becoming a haven for criminals, so what do you expect? You know, decent, hardworking Americans like my dad are getting rubbed out by social parasites. Parasites? Blacks, browns, yellow, whatever. REPORTER: I don't understand. You're saying you think maybe your father's murder was race-related? Yes, race-related. Every problem in this country is race-related, not just crime like... Immigration, AIDS, welfare. Those are problems of the black community the Hispanic community, the Asian community. They're not white problems. Derek, aren't those issues that deal more with poverty? No, you know. They're not products of their environments either. That's crap. Minorities don't give two shits about this country. They come here to exploit it, not to embrace it. Millions of white European-Americans came here and flourished. You know, within a generation. So what the fuck is the matter with these people? They have to go around shooting at firemen. What this sentence has to do with the murder of your father? Because my father was murdered doing his job. Putting out a fire in a fucking nigger neighborhood he shouldn't have given a shit about. He got shot by a fucking drug dealer who probably still collects a welfare check. That's enough. I'm sorry. Derek Vinyard was quite released from Chino earlier this morning after serving 3 and some-odd years. I think this is something we gotta keep an eye on. If something happens to him, things could get very ugly down by the beach. Just keep it low. DANNY: Venice Beach didn't always look like this. It used to be a great neighborhood. The boardwalk's always been a dump but when my dad moved us out here, Venice was a nice, quiet place to grow up. Over the years though, it's just gone to hell. The gangs are like a plague. They moved west from Inglewood and South Central and basically took over. It ain't fouling you. What's wrong with you?",

I don't give a shit! Go wait in the living room! God. I want him out of my house. I know, I know. Look. He's an idiot. He's always been an idiot. Whatever, dude. He can't help it. I gotta do that paper. Look, I'm gonna catch up with you later tonight. Hey, not at Cameron's. What? I need you to stay away from there. Why? I thought we were gonna hang. Trust me.

All right, listen up. We need to open our eyes. There's over 2 million illegal immigrants bedding down in this state tonight. This state spent $3 billion last year on services for those people who had no right to be here in the first place. 3 billion dollars. 400 million dollars just to lock up a bunch of illegal immigrant criminals who only got into this country because the fucking lNS decided it's not worth the effort to screen for convicted felons. Who gives a shit? Our government doesn't give a shit. Our border policy is a joke. So is anybody surprised that south of the border they're laughing at us? Laughing at our laws. Yeah. Every night thousands of these parasites stream across the border like some fucking piňata exploded. Don't laugh! There's nothing funny going on here. This is about your life and mine. It's about decent, hardworking Americans falling through the cracks and getting the shaft. Because the government cares more about the constitutional rights of a bunch of people who aren't even citizens of this country! On the Statue of Liberty, it says, \"Give me your tired, your hungry, your poor.\" Well, it's Americans who are tired and hungry and poor. And I say until you take care of that, close the fucking book! Because we're losing. We're losing our right to pursue our destiny. We're losing our freedom so that a bunch of fucking foreigners can come in here and exploit our country. And this isn't something that's going on far away. This isn't something that's happening in places we can't do anything about it. It's happening right here! Right in our neighborhood. Right in that building behind you. Archie Miller ran that grocery store since we were kids here. Dave worked there, Mike worked there. He went under and now some fucking Korean owns it, who fired these guys and is making a killing because he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers. I see this shit going on and I don't see anybody doing anything about it. And it fucking pisses me off! So look around you. This isn't our fucking neighborhood. It's a battlefield. We're on a battlefield tonight. Make a decision. Are we gonna stand on the sidelines, quietly standing there while our country gets raped? MEN: Fuck that.

MAN 5: Hey, that's a great color on you, you know. You can get a white woman's job, bitch. MAN 5: A little better than this one? White. MAN 5: You can move up in the world? Asshole! DEREK: Come on! Let's go. We're out of here. Everybody out. Let's go. Now. Now! All right, let's go! Let's go! MAN 3: Let's go. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go. No green card, no fucking work, comprendes? Come on. Come on! DEREK: Go, go, go. We're fucking done! Come on! DANNY: Dad was gone. But things were almost normal again. Derek had a good job. Mom was starting to live a little. Everyone was feeling so good that we just didn't see it coming. Maybe we should have. The irony is that most of the stores that were destroyed during the riots were owned by black people. That's stupid though. I mean why trash your own neighborhood? Well, that's my point. It's an irrational act. It's like an expression of rage by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system. Exactly. I mean, it's like we had in Watts or the riots in Chicago in '68 DEREK: It's crap. I don't buy that for a minute. Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage, that's such a cop-out. It's opportunism at its worst. That's a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store, nothing more. Another fact, these people ripped off the stores in their own communities all reflects the degree to which these people absolutely have no respect for the law at all. And certainly no concept of, like, community or civic responsibility. Wait a minute. White people commit crimes against white people too. But they're not offing each other in record numbers all over America. Look at the statistics, for chrissake. One in every 3 black males is in some phase of the correctional system. Is that a coincidence or do these people have, you know like, a racial commitment to crime? Not only that. They're proud of it. Well, maybe it says something about prejudice in the judicial system. Yeah, if you wanna talk about criminal statistics, you should wanna take a look at the social inequalities that produce them. Yap, yap. You know what? That's exactly what I hate because what you doing, Davina, is taking one thing and calling it something else and just, you know, alleviating the responsibility that these people have for their own actions. You know, it's like saying: \"It's not a riot, it's rage. It's not crime, it's poverty.\" It's just nonsense. It's bullshit. It's exactly what happened in this trial too. Because the media twisted things around so people gotta focused on, you know, these cops whether or not they'd get convicted and whether Rodney King's civil rights had been violated. I mean everybody lost sight of Rodney King himself. I mean he is a multiple felon by his own admission. He's high as a goddamn kite, driving 120 miles an hour down the highway. He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops and he attacks them. He attacked police officers. That's the bottom line. And he walked. And there's some yahoo with a video camera who turned it on halfway through so all we see is them hitting him. Exactly you know. Powell and Koon winding up and cracking him with billy clubs and Briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull. So it looks severe. You know and people behind: \"Oh, this poor guy.\" This poor guy who attacked 4 cops. And those cops end up on the stand defending themselves for using absolutely standard, textbook seIf-defense procedures. I don't think the tape showed that at all. You didn't think so? And what, you're an authority, Ma? Murray, what do you think? I did think that the police used their clubs rather excessively. Who you to say what's excessive? I think it was totally appropriate. I think they're in a better position to make that judgement call than you are. In fact, we as society, grant cops a certain amount of authority to make those callls because we acknowledge that their job is difficult and dangerous. You know? Unfortunately, very few people, like, respect that authority. Look who's talking about respect here, Mr. Junior-KKK. What? Davina. You wanna go to college, Davina. You should learn to listen. Derek. I didn't say I respected laws. I acknowledge a cop's authority. I don't respect any laws that let monkeys like Rodney King back on the street. Second, I am not, as you well know, a member of a low-rent, disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK. Please. So take your head out of your ass. You've gotten off the point. I mean I had a point. That wasn't any point. Do you have one? What is your point, Derek? All right, think about this. If Danny had been walking across the street that night and Rodney King had plowed into him. Can we just drop this Rodney King thing? Who would like some dessert? We're having a discussion. We're having a nice discussion, right? If Rodney King had been driving along, hopped up on Chivas Regal and PCP and killed Danny, you'd sing a very different tune about the... I didn't see him hit anybody in the tape and neither did you. He didn't happen to kill anybody. Thank God. Keep it down, okay? Ally's sleeping. If he had, though? Come on, think about it. If that fucking monkey had run some kid over everybody would have a very different opinion of this whole matter. They'd be focused on Rodney King and not on these officers. But instead, he just attacked a few cops. And so all of the sudden it's Hands Across America for this fucking total son of a bitch. I mean, it blows my mind. We're so hung up on this notion we have some obligation to help the struggling black man. You know, cut him some slack until he can overcome these historical injustices. It's crap. This stuff you guys are saying just perpetuates it. All this liberal nonsense. You know. Everyone's turning looking the other way while our country rots from inside out. In Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves, what, like, 130 years ago. How long does it take to get your act together? Well, Jews have been persecuted for over 5000 years. Are you saying that it's wrong to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism? STACEY: Forget that. I'm with you. I am with you alI the way, baby. I'm so sick of these liberal hypocrites. Here we go again. l love this part. This is great! Well, look at the way that they scapegoated Chief Gates. I mean you'd tell me they'd come down that hard on black Willie Williams? No way! Because that videotape was a setup to get rid of Gates. Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused? Yes. No, you cannot. Don't interrupt. Excuse me, I was talking. I listened to you. Don't interrupt her. Who the hell do you think you are? She's right in the middle of making a point. Who the hell do you think you are? Hey Davina, sit down! No. Fuck you! DEREK: Sit down! Be quiet! Shut up! MURRAY: Derek, calm down. Sit down! No. Derek, calm down. Shut up! Don't tell him to shut up! No. Sit your ass down! Fuck move! No. Sit down, shut your mouth! Get out of my way! Move! Goddamn it, Derek, move! Sit down, shut your mouth and give my girlfriend some respect. Derek, what are you trying to prove? Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey. Where do you think you're going? Get back. Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go! Stop. DEREK: Come here! You need to learn some fucking manners, Davina. Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up! Derek! Stop! She can't breathe! DORIS: Let her go! Will you apologize? Will you apologize? Are you? You're a fucking asshole. I hate you! What are you doing, Derek? This is your family. Right, my family. So you know what? I don't give two shits about you or anybody else or what you think. You're not part of it you never will be. That has nothing to do with it! DEREK: lt doesn't? You don't think l see what you're trying to do here? You think I'll sit here and smile while some fucking kike tries to fuck my mother? It's never gonna happen, Murray! Fucking forget it. Not on my watch. Not while I'm in this family. I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off and stick it up your ass before I let that happen. Coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner with your Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit? Fuck you! Yeah, walk out. Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading motherfucker! Get the fuck out of my house! You see this? That means \"not welcome.\" What did l do? You disgust me, you know that? You disgust me. Bring him to our table, primping your hair and your dress! Don't touch me! All tarted up! What did l do to you? How could you bring him to my father's table? How could you go from Dad to that? Aren't you ashamed? I'm ashamed that you came out of my body! Go run to your fucking kike! Go run to him! It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby. I'm so sorry, Doris. I really am. He's gone. He's just a boy without a father. Doris, you don't know the world your children are living in. Goodbye. Hey. You all right? Take this, you fucking dick! Hey, no. No, come here! Fuck you! Davina, calm down! Get off me! Calm down! Let me go, goddamn it! Sorry. Fuck you! I'm sorry. I would never hurt you. You know that. Come on, I screwed up. I lost control. It's not you. I'm sorry. Come on, I'd never hurt you guys. I'd never hurt you. You know that. I'd do anything for you. I don't believe you.

This stuff you guys are saying just perpetuates it. All this liberal nonsense. You know. Everyone's turning looking the other way while our country rots from inside out. In Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves, what, like, 130 years ago. How long does it take to get your act together? Well, Jews have been persecuted for over 5000 years. Are you saying that it's wrong to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism? STACEY: Forget that. I'm with you. I am with you alI the way, baby. I'm so sick of these liberal hypocrites. Here we go again. l love this part. This is great! Well, look at the way that they scapegoated Chief Gates. I mean you'd tell me they'd come down that hard on black Willie Williams? No way! Because that videotape was a setup to get rid of Gates. Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused? Yes. No, you cannot. Don't interrupt. Excuse me, I was talking. I listened to you. Don't interrupt her. Who the hell do you think you are? She's right in the middle of making a point. Who the hell do you think you are? Hey Davina, sit down! No. Fuck you! DEREK: Sit down! Be quiet! Shut up! MURRAY: Derek, calm down. Sit down! No. Derek, calm down. Shut up! Don't tell him to shut up! No. Sit your ass down! Fuck move! No. Sit down, shut your mouth! Get out of my way! Move! Goddamn it, Derek, move! Sit down, shut your mouth and give my girlfriend some respect. Derek, what are you trying to prove? Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey. Where do you think you're going? Get back. Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go! Stop. DEREK: Come here! You need to learn some fucking manners, Davina. Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up! Derek! Stop! She can't breathe! DORIS: Let her go! Will you apologize? Will you apologize? Are you? You're a fucking asshole. I hate you! What are you doing, Derek? This is your family. Right, my family. So you know what? I don't give two shits about you or anybody else or what you think. You're not part of it you never will be. That has nothing to do with it! DEREK: lt doesn't? You don't think l see what you're trying to do here? You think I'll sit here and smile while some fucking kike tries to fuck my mother? It's never gonna happen, Murray! Fucking forget it. Not on my watch. Not while I'm in this family. I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off and stick it up your ass before I let that happen. Coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner with your Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit? Fuck you! Yeah, walk out. Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading motherfucker! Get the fuck out of my house! You see this? That means \"not welcome.\" What did l do? You disgust me, you know that? You disgust me. Bring him to our table, primping your hair and your dress! Don't touch me! All tarted up! What did l do to you? How could you bring him to my father's table? How could you go from Dad to that? Aren't you ashamed? I'm ashamed that you came out of my body! Go run to your fucking kike! Go run to him! It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby. I'm so sorry, Doris. I really am. He's gone. He's just a boy without a father. Doris, you don't know the world your children are living in. Goodbye. Hey. You all right? Take this, you fucking dick! Hey, no. No, come here! Fuck you! Davina, calm down! Get off me! Calm down! Let me go, goddamn it! Sorry. Fuck you! I'm sorry. I would never hurt you. You know that. Come on, I screwed up. I lost control. It's not you. I'm sorry. Come on, I'd never hurt you guys. I'd never hurt you. You know that. I'd do anything for you. I don't believe you. I trust you, Derek."

He's here? Yeah, right he's here. He's fucking here. Go pay your respects. Fuck you, Seth. Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny. Father Vinyard? How's it going, man? I'm Jason and he is my buddy, Chris. We're friends with your brother. You are a fucking god, man! Oh, shit, yeah. STACEY: Derek! DEREK: Hey. I thought you turned that paper in. I did and now fucking Murray turned me in and so Sweeney's making me write another one. Good old Sweeney. He never stops trying, does he? He's one of those proud-to-be-nigger people. I hate those guys. Now, wait a minute, Danny. He's not proud. He's a manipulative, self-righteous Uncle Tom. He's trying to make you feel guilty about writing about Adolf Hitler. Yeah. Some nigger, some spic writes about Martin Luther King or fucking Cesar \"Commie\" Chavez gets a pat on the head. Yeah. I mean, you can see the hypocrisy in that, can't you? Definitely. STACEY: Come on, let's go. Let's go. No, listen to me. I wanna see you, okay? I do. But I gotta take care of something tonight. Okay. You understand? Yeah. I'm here. When you're ready, I'm here. Look, would you do something with me? Anything. Leave with me. Leave where? Leave here. Leave all this. Just come with me. Why would you wanna leave? They worship you. You're like a god to them. I mean if you think we had it good before, wait till you see what it's like now. Listen, I don't want all that. I don't want my family involved. Everything I've done here has fucked it all up. Do you understand? Would you think what you did was wrong? Oh, baby. Oh, come on. Those niggers got exactly what they deserved and we all know that. I understand you just got out but no one's gonna hurt you. No one can touch you. I mean there's a small army out there. We won't let a bunch of spooks kick us out of here. You're not listening to me, okay? I'm not scared. I don't want it anymore. I'm done with it. I'm through with this. It's.... It's bullshit, Stacey. Listen, you don't need this, Stacey. Come on, trust me. If you wanna be with me, just trust me. Come with me. Come on. You're nuts. You are nuts. No way. I don't think you realize what's been going on here. We are 10 times what we were and we are bloody organized. I mean, it is like nothing you have ever seen! This is a mistake. Forget it. Wait a second. Wait a second. What was a mistake? Stacey, just say goodbye. Just say goodbye. This isn't you. I know you. You don't know anything about me, Stacey. Hey. Are you Danny's brother? Yeah. LlZZY: Tell him Lizzy's looking for him. Lizzy. Thank you. We'll let the niggers, kikes and spics grab for their piece of the pie. Can't blame them. Of course, they're gonna have to fight to get it. And if we scare the fuck out of people and a few people get killed in the process, so be it. DEREK: You'll put that in your paper, Danny? Hey, man. Well, look who's here. The return of the soldier. What are you doing here, Danny? Come on, man. I had to check it out. You knew I was gonna come. CAMERON: Let the kid alone, Derek. He knows when to go to bed. Go wait outside. Come on Der, I'm not doing anything. Come on! There's a little blond girl sitting out there. She keeps asking for you. She's dying. Come on. Ok, well, I gotta check out. Go easy on her. All right. Wait for me right outside. Take it easy. Chill out. You're on safe ground. You don't have to watch your ass around here. Come on, sit down. Relax. You know, I'm sorry. The party was a little quick. But we're just so damned glad you're back, Derek. It's only natural you should feel a little funny. I don't feel funny, Cam. You know, you made the fat kid a little nervous. He thinks the joint messed with your mind. It did. Glory, glory hallelujah Glory, glory hallelujah The white man marches on You see, things have changed since you've been gone, Derek. You talk about organization? Wait till you see what we've done with the Internet. We've got every gang from Seattle to San Diego working together now. They're not competing anymore. They're consolidated. Only thing we lack is a little overall leadership. And that's where you come in. Because people out there, they've got a lot of respect for you, Derek. When you're ready, you'll come talk to me about it. Well, you can forget about that. I'm done with it, Cam. Yeah, well, I know you grew out of that shaved-head bullshit a long time ago, thank God. I like your hair the way it is now. You see, that's what I mean, Derek. We're thinking bigger now. No more of this fucking grocery store. You're not listening to me. I am done with it. All that bullshit out there and all your bullshit too. I'm out. I understand how you feel. I mean you've just done some hard time. Don't you fucking talk to me about hard time. You don't know a thing about it. Yeah, I've done mine. You didn't do shit. I found out about your little prison story. You did 2 months, then rolled over on 2 kids and let them go down for you. So don't feed me your fucking lies, Cameron! All right. This is stupid. I'm done. You go cool off. Get laid. Do something. Get your head on straight, then I'll talk to you. But it doesn't really matter if I don't, does it? Because you got the next crop all lined up and ready to go you fucking chicken hawk! Excuse me? You prey on people, Cam! You use them! I lost 3 years of my life for your fucking phony cause but I am onto you now, you fucking snake. Hey, Derek. Watch it. Be careful. Remember where you are. This is not some fucking country club where you can waltz in and out of here. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! I came in here to tell you one thing: I am out. Out! And Danny is out too. And if you come near my family again, I'm gonna fucking kill you. Well, excuse me, but fuck you, Derek. You can't come barking threats at me. Look, you can do whatever you want but Danny is a good kid. He's not some whining pussy like you. He needs my help and I'm gonna give it to him. If you come near Danny again, I will feed you your fucking heart, Cameron. I won't have to. He'll come to me. I'm more important to him now than you'll ever be.",

Come on, let's go. Good night. I'm gonna take a shower, all right? DANNY: It's hard to look back and see the truth about people you love. I think if you asked Derek why it all went the way it did, and where it all started he'd still say it started when our father was murdered. But the truth is, it started earlier. All right. Are we all meeting together for the game tonight? Yes, definitely. Ben's Burgers, 7:00, then we go watch the big guy play. DORIS: Okay. Yeah. Psyching up for the game? Yeah, I'm always ready for that. I got an English exam 3rd period. I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready. What's the matter, afraid you're gonna get a B? Might do you good. B minus. Don't laugh. I'm tiring. This guy is different. Dr. Sweeney! This guy's unbelievable. I've never had a teacher like this. He's got two Ph.D.s. I don't know what he's doing teaching at our school. He's not like other teachers. What's he got you reading? We got this essay exam on this book, Native Son. All on this one book. Native Son. What's that? I don't know that. DORIS: That's a big surprise. What? I read. Honey, they don't teach Tom Clancy at school. Well, they don't. So, what is it? What is this Native Son? What is it? It's like this book about this black guy, you know We're doing this whole black literature unit. What is it, Black History Month? No, it's just like.... This guy Sweeney, you know, it's part of the course now. Yeah. What? Nothing. It's just, you know. It's everywhere I look now. What? This affirmative blaction. Honey, a few new books doesn't qualify as affirmative black action. Read the book, ace the guy's test. Just don't swallow everything he feeds you whole. You know, just because you see it on the evening news. I know but like what? All this stuff about making everything equal. It's not that simple. Look, now you got this book, Native Son. What happened to the other books in the course? They're not any good anymore because Mr. Two-Ph.D.s says they aren't? Are you gonna trade in great books for black books? Does that make sense? You gotta question these things, Derek. You gotta look at the whole picture. We're talking about books here. But I'm also talking about my job. I got two black guys on my squad now who got their job over a couple of white guys who actually scored higher on the test. That make sense? Yeah sure, everything's equal now but I got two guys watching my back, responsible for my life who aren't as good as two others. They only got the job because they were black. Not because they were the best. That sucks. DENNlS: Yeah. Is that what America is about? No. America's about \"best man for the job.\" You do your best, you get the job. You know, this affirmative action crap.... I don't know what that's about. It is like some hidden agenda or something going on. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, I do. I don't know, I didn't think about it like that. Well.... This guy, though.... I don't know. Dr. Sweeney, he comes on, like, so strong it's kind of hard not to listen to him. But... I don't know, maybe some of what he says is kind of... It's bullshit. Yeah. Yeah, maybe. No, no. It's nigger bullshit. You see that, don't you? Yeah. You gotta watch out for that. Yeah, I get what you're saying. l will. Good boy. I'm proud of you. Don't worry about it. DANNY: It's 5:40 a.m. and in about one minute, I'm gonna watch the sun come up. I don't know if I've ever done that. Anyway, we're gonna try to pick things up and start over. lt won't be easy but we're all together again. And I feel good. I'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted. If I hit the social significance, or whatever you're looking for. But, for what it's worth, thanks a lot. Wow. You look great. Look at you. Yeah. Gotta dress up for the parole officer. Is she cute? She is a fat guy named Hector. So I'm out of luck. Ma, I just gotta check in, then I'm gonna see about getting my old job back. Great. Good morning. DORIS: Yes, my love. Davina, can you? Your sister's gonna help you, honey. DAVINA: You look great. Knock them dead. Thanks. DAVINA: What would you like to wear? ALLY: I wanna wear my blue dress today. You do look good. Yeah? I feel silly. You look good. DEREK: Yeah? You feel good? Yeah. Yeah. I feel, you know... ...a little.... I'm getting there.

The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature.\"",
