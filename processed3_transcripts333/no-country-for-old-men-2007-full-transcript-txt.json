      "raw_text": "I was sheriff of this county when I was 25 years old. Hard to believe. My grandfather was a lawman. Father, too. Me and him was sheriffs at the same time, him up in Plano and me out here. I think he's pretty proud of that. I know I was. Some of the old-time sheriffs never even wore a gun. A lot of folks find that hard to believe. Jim Scarborough never carried one. That's the younger Jim. Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one up in Comanche County. I always liked to hear about the old-timers. Never missed a chance to do so. You can't help but compare yourself against the old-timers. Can't help but wonder how they'd have operated these times. There's this boy I sent to the electric chair at Huntsville here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killed a 14-year-old girl. Paper said it was a crime of passion, but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said if they turned him out, he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about 15 minutes. I don't know what to make of that. I sure do don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. Man would have to put his soul at hazard. He'd have to say, \"Okay. \"I'll be part Of this world.\" Yes, sir, I just walked in the door. Sheriff, he had some sort of thing on him, like a oxygen tank for emphysema or something and a hose that run down his sleeve. Oxygen tank? What the hell's he got that for? You got me. Well, you can look at it when you get in. I'll be down there in a bit. Yes, sir, I got it under control. - Howdy. What's this about? - Step out of the car, please, sir. - What is that? - I need you to step out of the car, sir. - What is that for? - Would you... Would you hold still, please, sir? You hold still. Shit. I ain't got no water. I told you, I ain't got no agua. Do you speak English? Where's the last guy? Último hombre. Last man standing. There must have been one. Where'd he go? I reckon I go out the way I come in. There ain't no lobos. You stopped to watch your backtrack.",

If you don't want to accept that, I don't know what else I can do for you. - Will there be something else? - I don't know. Will there? Is something wrong? - With what? - With anything. Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything? - Will there be anything else? - You already asked me that.

I said, what time do you go to bed? Somewhere around 9:30. I'd say around 9:30. I could come back then. Why would you be coming back? We'll be closed. Yeah, you said that. Well, I got to close now.

Well, we need to know what we're calling it for here. You need to call it. I can't call it for you, or it wouldn't be fair. - I didn't put nothing up. - Yes, you did. You've been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. - You know what date is on this coin? - No. 1958. It's been travelling 22 years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails. And you have to say. Call it. Well, look, I need to know what I stand to win. Everything. - How's that? - You stand to win everything. Call it. All right. Heads, then. Well done. Don't put it in your pocket, sir. Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter. - Where do you want me to put it? - Anywhere, not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is. Llewelyn? What the hell? - The Odessa. - Why would we go to Odessa? No, not we. You. You stay with your mother. Well, how come? Look, right now it's midnight, Sunday. The courthouse opens nine hours from now. Someone's gonna be calling in the vehicle number on the inspection plate on my truck. And around 9:30, they'll show up here. But for how long do we have to... Baby, at what point would you quit bothering to look for your $2 million? What am I supposed to tell Mama? Why don't you try standing in the door and hollering, \"Mama, I'm home\"? - Llewelyn... - Come on, pack your things. Anything you leave, you ain't gonna see again. Well, don't fall down apologising. Baby, things happen- Come on, I can't take them back. Mind riding bitch? This his truck? Got a screwgie? Who cut his tyres? Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us. - That is a dead dog. - Yes, it is. - Where's the receiver? - I've got it. These are some ripe petunias. Hold this, please. Want it? You getting anything on this? Not a bleep. All right. Give me that. - I thought it was a car afire. - It is a car afire. Wendell said there's something in the back country, too. Step in there. When's the county gonna start paying a rental on my horse?",

Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that. Yes, sir. We should've brought wienies. That look like about a '77 Ford to you, Wendell? - It could be. - I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind. The old boy shot by the highway? Yes, sir. His vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed that man on the highway, swapped for his car and now here it is, and he's swapped again for God knows what. That's very linear, Sheriff. - Age'll flatten a man, Wendell. - Yes, sir. - Then there's this other. - Yup. You ride Winston. - You sure? - Oh, I'm more than sure. If anything happens to Loretta's horse out here, I can tell you right now, I don't want to be the party that was aboard. It's the same tyre tread coming back as going. Made about the same time, too. You can see the sipes real clear. Somebody's pried the inspection plate off the door on this one. I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss. - Llewelyn Moss? - That's the boy. - You figure him for a dope runner? - I don't know. I kindly doubt it. OK Corral's just yonder.

Yes, sir. We should've brought wienies. That look like about a '77 Ford to you, Wendell? - It could be. - I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind. The old boy shot by the highway? Yes, sir. His vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed that man on the highway, swapped for his car and now here it is, and he's swapped again for God knows what. That's very linear, Sheriff. - Age'll flatten a man, Wendell. - Yes, sir. - Then there's this other. - Yup. You ride Winston. - You sure? - Oh, I'm more than sure. If anything happens to Loretta's horse out here, I can tell you right now, I don't want to be the party that was aboard. It's the same tyre tread coming back as going. Made about the same time, too. You can see the sipes real clear. Somebody's pried the inspection plate off the door on this one. I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss. - Llewelyn Moss? - That's the boy. - You figure him for a dope runner? - I don't know. I kindly doubt it. OK Corral's just yonder.

There's someone who been looking for me. Not police. You just call me if anyone else checks in tonight. And by anyone, I mean any swinging dick. There just ain't no way. Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you. I need you to drive me on out of here. - Why not? - I don't know, man. Could you have stayed... Were you in a car accident? I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat. Let me see the money. Were you in a car accident? Yeah. - Okay, give me the money. - It's right here. Give me the clothes. Let him hold the money. Now give it here. Give me that beer, too. How much? Brian, give him the beer. Just went up. Any word on those vehicles yet? Sheriff, I found out everything there was to find. Those vehicles are titled and registered to deceased people. The owner of that Bronco's been dead 20 years. Do you want me to see what I can find out about the Mexican ones? No. Lord, no. There's this month's cheques. That DEA agent called again. You don't wanna talk to him? Gonna try to keep from it much as I can. He's going back out there. Wanted to know if you wanted to go with him. That's cordial of him. Can I get you to call Loretta for me, tell her I'm going to Odessa to see Carla Jean Moss? Yes, Sheriff. I'll call her when I get done. I'd call her now, but if she want me to come home, I just might. Do you want me to wait till you quit the building? You don't wanna lie without what it's absolutely necessary."

She writes me pretty regular, keeps me up on the family news. - Didn't know there was any. - Told me you're quitting. - You want a cup? - Appreciate it. How fresh is that coffee? I generally make a fresh pot every week, even if there's some left over. That man that shot you died in prison? Angola. Yeah. What'd you done, he'd have been released? Oh, I don't know. Nothing. Wouldn't be no point in it. Kindly surprised to hear you say that. Well, all the time you spend trying to get back what's been took from you, more is going out the door. After a while, you just have to try to get a tourniquet on it. Your granddad never asked me to sign on as a deputy. Loretta tells me you're quitting. - How come you doing that? - I don't know.

You don't know what he thinks. I sent Uncle Mac's thumb buster and badge over to the Rangers, put it in their museum. Your daddy ever tell you how Uncle Mac come to his reward? Gunned down on his own porch over in Hudspeth County. Seven or eight of them come up there, all wanting this, wanting that. Uncle Mac went back in the house to get the shotgun, well... They was ahead of him. Shot him in his doorway. Aunt Ella come out, tried to stop the bleeding. Uncle Mac all the while trying to get that shotgun. They just sat there on their horses, watching him die. After a while one of them said something in Indian and they turned, left out. Uncle Mac knew the score, even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung. And that was that, as they say. When'd he die? 1909. No, I mean, was it right away, or in the night or... When was it? I believe it was that night. She buried him the next morning. Digging in that hard old caliche. What you got ain't nothing new. This country is hard on people. You can't stop what's coming. It ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity. I knew this wasn't done with.",
