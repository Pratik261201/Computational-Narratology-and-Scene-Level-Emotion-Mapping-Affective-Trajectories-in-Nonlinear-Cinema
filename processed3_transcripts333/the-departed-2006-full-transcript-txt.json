      "raw_text": "FRANK: I don't wanna be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me. Years ago, we had the Church. That was only a way of saying we had each other. But now, I don't know. It's a funny thing. It put hate in your heart. The Knights of Columbus were real head-breakers. True guineas. They took over their piece of the city. Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a fucking job... ... we had the presidency. May he rest in peace. That's what the niggers don't realize. If I got one thing against the black chappies, it's this: No one gives it to you. You have to take it. Vin, don't make me have to come down here again for this. Won't happen again, Mr. C. Carmen's developing into a fine young lady. You should be proud. You get your period yet, Carmen? You Johnny Sullivan's kid? - You live with your grandmother? - Yeah. Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread, couple half-gallons of milk. Do you like bologna and cheese? Give him some cold cuts. Throw some mayo in. You like comic books? You do good in school? - Yeah. - That's good. I did too. They call that a paradox. Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup. You ever wanna earn a little extra money, you come by L Street. You know where I am on L Street? Good. - Good boy. - Thanks. To you, O Lord, we commend the soul of Alphonsus, your servant. In the sight of this world, he is now dead. Forgive whatever sins he committed... ...through human weakness. - Amen. The Church wants you in your place. Kneel, stand, kneel, stand. If you go for that sort of thing, I don't know what to do for you. A man makes his own way. No one gives it to you. You have to take it. - James Joyce. - Smart, Colin. Guineas from the North End, down Providence... ...tried to tell me what to do. And something maybe happened to them. Maybe like that: Jeez. She fell funny. Francis, you really should see somebody. When you decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you in the Church. When I was your age, they would say we could become cops or criminals. Today what I'm saying to you is this: When you're facing a loaded gun... ...what's the difference? Hm? That's my boy. Terminal ballistics is the study of a projectile... ...as it hits a target and the destruction that it causes.",

Three-decker men at best. You, however, grew up... ...on the North Shore, huh? Well, la-di-fucking-da. You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right? One kid with your old man, one kid with your mother. You're upper-middle class during the weeks, then you're hanging... ...in the Southie projects with your daddy, the fucking donkey... ...on the weekends. I got that right? Yup. You have different accents? You did, didn't you, you little fucking snake? - You were like different people. - You a psychiatrist? If I was, I'd ask you why you're a statie making 30 grand a year. And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud I wouldn't get an answer. Tell me, what's a lace-curtain fucker like you doing in the staties? Well, families are always rising or falling in America, am I right? - Who said that? - Hawthorne. What's the matter, smart-ass, you don't know any fucking Shakespeare? We have a question. Do you wanna be a cop, or do you wanna appear to be a cop? It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV. A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger through a window... I'm set without your own personal job application, sergeant. - What did you say? - Sir, what do you want from me? Hey, he can't help you. I know what you are. I know what you are... ...and I know what you're not. I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna help you understand something. You're no fucking cop."

Beeper number. - And the guy didn't show up? - No. - And he beeped him? - Twice. Give me your phone. Turn that off. - What? - Turn the fucking camera off. Give it to me. He doesn't know what the fucking lawyer looks like. Whose briefcase is this? All right. - It's off? - You're good. Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons. - He can't do that. - He just did. - You my attorney? - What do you think? Have you made statements or phone calls... ...I need to be made aware of? I beeped you. The card they gave me. That's it. - That's it? - That's it. You need to call your mother... ...tell her you're not gonna be home for supper. Camera's off. It's off. Call your mother. Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid right now. I don't know where they're going, but they do. And so do you. So make the call. Lookit, fuckstick, you don't gotta trust me... ...just listen to what I'm saying to you. Mom, I'm not gonna make it home for supper. Sorry, yeah, I got held up. Yeah, no, you carry on without me. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Bye. Everybody out. Move. Thank you. So who are you? I think you need a different attorney, Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day. So when the fuck am I gonna get out? All right, run the last number he called. That's his house. I'll swear to the judge I surveilled him there... ...and abra-fucking-cadabra, we got a warrant. - Why did you use my phone? - Because you didn't go in there. The light's nice here in the morning. So do you wanna talk about last night? You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make too big a deal out of it. It's actually quite common. I gotta go to work. Do you lie? Why? Do you? No, I'm asking if you lie. Honesty is not synonymous with truth. Yeah, you lie. You lie. Is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally..."

And I think, \"Could I do murder?\" And all I can answer myself is: \"What's the difference?\" Give them up to the Almighty. You see, that's my point, you know? You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice... ...I quit. You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a fucking bullet in your head... ...as if you were anybody else. Okay? You got something you wanna ask me? Look, you're 70 years old, Frank. I'm just saying, okay? One of your guys is gonna pop you. - One of your guys is gonna pop you. - Yeah, yeah. As for running drugs, what the fuck are you doing? You don't need the money or the pain in the ass. And they will catch you. I haven't needed the money... ...since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade. Tell you the truth, I don't need pussy anymore, either. But I like it. Point I'm making here is, Bill... ...I got this rat... ...this gnawing, cheese-eating, fucking rat... ...and it brings up questions. You know. See, Bill, like, you're the new guy. Girlfriend... Mm... Why don't you stay in the bar that night I got your numbers? Social-security numbers. - Yeah. - Everybody's fucking numbers. Is there something that you just wanna go ahead and ask me? Because I'll give you the fucking answer, all right? Frank, look at me. Look at me. I'm not the fucking rat. Okay? I'm not the fucking rat. Start with you agree there is a rat. You said there is one, all right? I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty good at what you do. Sure. Sure, Will. You, William. What would you do? Frank, how many of these guys..."

What do you mean, off the building? - Something came off the fucking roof. - It's a fucking body. We can't get a visual. Want us to get out? We gotta get on foot if you want me to get up on this thing. - Where were you? - What happened? You're fucking late! Get in the van! What do you mean, off the roof? What's going on? I came to meet you. - What the fuck...? - Get in the van! I got four armed men right out front. You want us to pursue? No, do not pursue. Stay in the car. - Fuck. No fucking pursuit. - I need information. What came off the roof? - No pursuit. - That's bullshit. Fuck this. Ah! Fitzy! Get in the van! Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move! All right. I got him. 32X to CP. We're being fired upon! An officer is down. I repeat, an officer is down. A trooper's been shot! Send some back... So do you know why Queenan went into that building? - No. - Well, a better question... ...is why the fuck were your guys following him? I told Internal Investigations to follow Captain Queenan. - Why? - That's Internal Investigations' business. Fucking piece of shit! - All right. - Hey, hey! Fucking bitch! Let him go! Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain anything to anybody! I can fucking investigate anybody I want to! - Come on! - I don't give a fuck what you think! I got reason to believe that Queenan got killed by his fucking undercover. That's a fucking lie. He has fucking information in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan. I need access to those files. I forgot the password but if you come with me I'll give it to you. - That's a fucking lie. - Nobody calls me a liar! Shut up! Work with the tech guys to unlock those files. - Dignam, take a leave of absence. - Take a leave of what? Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now. I don't care. I'd rather hand in my papers first. World needs plenty of bartenders. Two weeks with pay. Good. - Piece of shit. - Fuck off. - I need those codes. - No. You want those codes. So where the fuck were you? Well, boss told me to go home. Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. But you weren't at fucking home. So where the fuck were you? I was at the grocery store with no signal, all right? When I got the signal, I got the call.
