      "raw_text": "Music has always been like a curse with me. I've always felt driven to play it. It' the first' thing in my life. Go to bed thinking about it and wake up thinking about it. It's always there. It comes before everything. Living is an adventure and a challenge. It wasn't about' standing still and becoming safe. Bu! I've always been the way I am, been like this all my life. If anybody wants to keep creating, they have to be about change. I was born in Alton, Illinois, a little river town up on the Mississippi River. My father moved the family to East St. Louis. East St. Louis and St. Louis were country towns full of country people. Especially the white people from around there. Really country, and racist to the bone. Miles grew up in a wealthy situation. His father was a dentist. He also had a farm and raised cattle and hogs. They were the cream of the crop in the city. He was the second richest guy in the state of Illinois. Black man. But, during the period that he grew up in, it's still Jim Crow America. And so, his father's wealth wouldn't have protected him from segregation and racism in a place like East St. Louis. On my 73th birthday, my father bought me a new trumpet. My mother wanted me to have a violin, but my father overruled her. This caused a big argument between them. They had been at each ofher's throats since I was a little kid. He would hear his mother and father talking and fussing. I guess that's what got in his mind as a young boy. Miles absorbed that. He absorbed all of that. The anger, that kind of attitude toward women. I remember my mother picking up things and throwing them at my father. He got so mad with her he punched her. He knocked a couple of teeth right out of her mouth. it had to affect us somehow, although I don't really know how. Miles was considered a genius, but he was also considered, I guess, weird. Miles would go into the woods, listening to the animals or listening to the birds, and play what he was hearing. He always had his own way of doing things. Miles started very early as a member of the trumpet section in Eddie Randle's Blue Devils. Miles is young and small and can barely fill the suit he had to wear for these gigs. While the other guys in Eddie Randle's band were working their day jobs, this teenager, Miles Davis, quickly becomes the musical director for this popular dance band.",

      "raw_text": "The real pivot point for Miles is when, during his summer after high school, he is invited to sit in with the Billy Eckstine band. Both Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie are in that band. You've got the laboratory, the future of modern jazz, right there in this big band. The greatest feeling I ever had in my life, with my clothes on, was when I first met Deez and Bird. I was 18 years old. I decided right then and there I had to be in New York, on 52nd Street, where the action was. Walter Cronkite reporting. War years always bring on new fads and tastes and the strangest taste around is the excitement generated by the musical noise called jazz. This strange music has been accused of everything, including the bad weather and the present decay and morality. 52nd Street was a mecca of jazz clubs. They had jazz clubs on both sides of the street. I had never heard no shit like they was playing on 52nd St. We would go down there and listen in amazement'. That shit was so good it was scary. Each little place had a speaker outside where you could hear what was going on inside. You could stand outside and hear the music until the club's doorman would chase you away. Miles enrolled at Juilliard 'cause he wanted to learn music, and because his mother wanted him to be a trained musician and all that. He is serious about Juilliard, he's seriously committed to it. And he values what Juilliard might have to offer. A lot of the old guys thought that if you went to school, it would make you play like you were White. If you learned something from theory, you would lose the feeling in your playing. I would go to the library and borrow scores by all those great composers. I wanted to see what' was going on in all of music. And yet he knows there's something else going on, and it's not happening at Juilliard. So, he was to go to Juilliard in the daytime, and at night, he'd be on 52nd Street. I spent my first Week in New York looking for Bird and Dizzy. I spent all my money and didn't find them. Then, one night', I heard this voice from behind me say, \"Hey, Miles, I heard you've been looking for me. I turned around and there was Bird. Bebop musicians were rocket scientists. You can compare bebop to the Manhattan Project.",

      "raw_text": "It was developed by some serious sound physicists blowing their brains out to push this music as far as they could. So, Miles stepped into a hotbed of music research and development. Bebop was a black music. It was a music by black musicians who wanted to get away from any kind of hint of minstrelsy. No smiling, laughing, grinning and dancing. No entertaining, man. They wanted to be an artist just like Stravinsky, just like Stravinsky who was just a pure artist. Miles saw these very elegantly-dressed characters. The dignity and the nobility that came with that. And the swagger. Very soon after Miles starts his Juilliard studies, Irene arrives, his high school sweetheart, with their child and with another baby on the way. all of a sudden, there she was, knocking on my motherfucking door. My mother had told her to come. It seems almost impossible, what he would have been trying to do at that age. There's the domestic situation with children, there's the kind of time required of anyone who's a serious student at Juilliard, but there's also the kind of time and commitment that this music will take. And, at some point, something has to give. Music was everything. It was everything. It was sexual, sensuous. Everything, power. Everything, humour. And he could not share that. So, somebody had to play second fiddle to that. One day, the teacher said, \"The blues grew out of the downtrodden suffering of slavery and the crying and wailing. This became the blues of people in chains.\" Miles has been back in the room somewhere and he raises his hand while she's talking. She says, \"Yes?\" He said, \"You're a goddamn liar.\" He walked out of the room. Miles, within months, is hanging with Bird, he's recording with Bird. He really arrives, like, right away. Every night, he'd get on the stand with Bird, Bird would play the head of the tune and just leave him on stage by himself. He said he threw up every night because he was so stressed out and humiliated. Those 'cats' could wear him out on the horn any night. But he figured something else out. He comes up with a style that is truly reflective of who he is. Straight tone, lyricism. It is him. It is uniquely, organically him. Miles meets Gil Evans and there's this level of mutual respect and mutual dedication to the music that will last a lifetime.",

So, if he had that opportunity, as he had at Newport, he was going for it, and with a vengeance. Miles put the bell of his horn right into the microphone and changed the whole world of jazz right there. And changed his career right there. Because the beauty of that song and the beauty of Miles's trumpet made bebop a music that could be accepted by everybody. They could now put on Miles's music while they were making love. It takes a lot of courage to play a ballad. It's easy to hide with a bunch of notes all over the place, and, \"Look what I can do...\" \"Look what I can do.\" You know, okay.

He basically took the handcuffs off the musicians and said, \"Here, do you, be you.\" \"I'm just going to let the music live, let it breathe and let it develop as we feel it.\" Miles thought he was just dispatching his obligation as fast as he could, but in fact they are gems of spontaneous jazz music. Two marathon sessions, three hours or more of recorded music. One of the great feats, really, of jazz history. I first met Miles Davis, I was performing with the Katherine Dunham Company. It was the introduction to so many different people that I met at that time in the show business world. I mean, I was in Paris, I was in Berlin, I was everywhere. I was told I had the best legs in the business. Hugh O'Brian wanted to date me. Rory Calhoun wanted to take me to Las Vegas. Oh God, trying to think of all the different gentlemen. Well, as a dancer, I was spectacular on that stage and I guess they just wanted to find out more about me. I didn't know that much about jazz. Who I did know about was Johnny Mathis. I was performing at Ciro's and Miles saw the performance. And he was smitten right away, but so was everybody else. This was just another chapter of gentlemen wanting to be with Frances. Sammy Davis Jr. asked me to join this new play that he was doing called 'Mr Wonderful'. On my way to rehearsal one day, Miles is coming down the street and we looked at each other and he looked at me and he said, \"Now that I found you, I'll never let you go.\" And what happened was, I moved in with him. Frances Taylor was really a muse, an inspiration. She was the most inspirational person he had partnered with, the one he was with the longest. She was someone who gave him stability and love at a time when he produced some of his most groundbreaking and popular work. He had to go off to Paris and he left me the music. I fell in love with his sound, it got to me. And I just played it over and over. And that was my introduction to his music.",

If Miles thought that that was gonna be like that, he would've asked for the building, and he would've asked for two Ferraris outside right now. He would've really gone crazy.

And, for a long time, it worked for me. I went to the Village Vanguard where Miles was performing and I said, \"Mr Davis, my name is Archie Shepp, I wonder if you'd let me sit in.\" And he said, \"Archie who?\" And I said, \"Archie Shepp.\" He said, \"Fuck you. You can't sit in with me.\" Miles didn't care. Miles didn't have to please anybody but Miles. Miles was not interested. You know what I mean?

He was angry, antisocial, but oftentimes those insecurities and those demons are the very things that are the basis of arts so that art becomes a way of healing.

Who are you?\" 'Kind of Blue' has just come out, he is the talk of the town. He is at the top of the marquee, top of his popularity. The guy said, \"I don't care, you just can't stand there.\" Miles said, \"Well, I'm not moving.\" I just looked at his face real straight and hard, and I didn't move. Miles, at that point, was in such good shape that it was hard for them to actually get a hand on him. From out of nowhere, this white detective runs in and, bam, hits me on the head.

      "raw_text": "it was my album and I was Frances's prince. so, I was able to put Frances on the cover. He was standing up for the beauty of black women. And saying, \"This beauty here is the beauty that I'm projecting through this music, through this song.\" A major statement to make. And I'm sure it was just because he thought his wife was hot, and fine too. Everybody wanted to be in 'West Side Story'. Jerome Robbins, Stephen Sondheim, it was, like, the one. There were at least, I'd say, 300 girls auditioning. I got on stage, and I stood up there and I snapped my fingers, and I went... I did an Ella Fitzgerald scat. Jerome Robbins and they all freaked out. I was in, I was in. Around this time, I was drinking more than I had in the past and I was snorting a lot of cocaine. That combination can make you real irritable. Frances was the only woman that I had ever been jealous of. And being jealous and using drugs and drinking, she just looked at me like I was crazy, which I was at the time. I thought was sane and on top of the world. He was a jealous person when it came to me. He just couldn't handle me being with these people and getting all of this attention. That's when he came to the theatre and picked me up in his Ferrari, and said, \"I want you out of 'West Side Story'. A woman should be with her man.\" I froze.

        "it was my album and I was Frances's prince. so, I was able to put Frances on the cover. He was standing up for the beauty of black women. And saying, \"This beauty here is the beauty that I'm projecting through this music, through this song.\" A major statement to make. And I'm sure it was just because he thought his wife was hot, and fine too. Everybody wanted to be in 'West Side Story'. Jerome Robbins, Stephen Sondheim, it was, like, the one. There were at least, I'd say, 300 girls auditioning. I got on stage, and I stood up there and I snapped my fingers, and I went... I did an Ella Fitzgerald scat. Jerome Robbins and they all freaked out. I was in, I was in. Around this time, I was drinking more than I had in the past and I was snorting a lot of cocaine. That combination can make you real irritable. Frances was the only woman that I had ever been jealous of. And being jealous and using drugs and drinking, she just looked at me like I was crazy, which I was at the time. I thought was sane and on top of the world. He was a jealous person when it came to me. He just couldn't handle me being with these people and getting all of this attention. That's when he came to the theatre and picked me up in his Ferrari, and said, \"I want you out of 'West Side Story'. A woman should be with her man.\" I froze. But I was in love with him and I did as he said. I quit the show. He sent for his children Cheryl and Gregory and little Miles. What I ended up doing was performing in the kitchen.

I went by his house, he had a bunch of funny-looking suits, and things hanging in his closet, funny-looking shoes, hats and all of that. I said, \"What's going on, man?\" So, he changed up, he went from that to that. I wanted to change course, I had to change course for me to continue to believe in and love what I was playing. My interest was in an electronic bass player. It gave me what l wanted to hear instead of the stand-up bass.

I told the musicians that they could do anything they wanted, play anything they heard, so that's what they did. There were four percussion players playing at the same time, two bassists playing at the same time, two or three keyboard players playing at the same time, a guitar. It was a great, massive improvisation. All he had me bring was a cymbal and a snare drum. And we went over the first part of 'Bitches Brew'... and then... You hear Miles's trumpet bouncing against the buildings at night, 3 o'clock in the morning. It sounds like New York is a grand canyon of buildings. It's this ominous thing, it's like something getting ready to happen.",

There would be cocaine smudges on his face and I'd wanna say something but I was too afraid. He would kind of nudge me over, and he'd say, \"You fucked her.\" And I'd say, \"I didn't fuck her.\" He goes, \"We're not leaving 'til you tell me you fucked her.\" He'd shut the car off. I said, \"All right. I fucked her on the hood. Can we go?\" And he goes, \"And I thought we were friends.\" This is an evening with Miles. Miles would come around during that time. He needed money and we'd lend him some money, which we figured was gone.

She had been dropping by throughout all of this, but now she started coming by more often. He was in terrifically bad health in those years. It was thought by many people he was in such bad shape that he would never play music again. He even thought he might never play music again. Cicely inspires him to see, once again, that he has something to offer, that with his creativity, his creative voice, he has not reached his creative peak. She helped run all those people out' of my house. She kind of protected me and started seeing that I ate the right things and didn't drink as much. She helped get me off cocaine. She would feed me health foods, a lot' of vegetables, and a whole lot of juices. He was running up and down the beach and trying to be a vegetarian, which was amazing because he couldn't do it. Miles would say, \"Come by the house, pick me up, man, take me somewhere where they got meat. Just let me smell the smells and then get me a hot link sandwich.\" Miles needed those years to summon up the strength to kick drugs, to play again, to handle the public, to handle the touring, to handle the critics, to live.

He looked at things differently, he saw things differently. You have to be true to yourself, and I think a lot of that was his philosophy. How can someone come up with such beautiful music when you can have that other side? Sometimes I couldn't take it. Sometimes it was just perfecto. I don't regret, I don't forget, but I still love."
