I do things better because I can see it all laid out like a map. Have you ever looked at a map? - Yes. - Do you know how to read a map? If I'm not mistaken. - Do you know how to read a map? - Yeah. Your father's a perfectly good guy, but there's a lot of stuff that he just doesn't understand about the world - that I understand. - My dad... - Wait. Listen. - My daddy's... I haven't asked you a question yet. I haven't asked you a question. - Listen. Shh. - My daddy... don't tell your father. Shut up! Be quiet. Shush. I haven't asked you the question yet. I haven't asked you anything. Listen. Shh. Quiet. We got it. Don't worry about it. Listen. If you could take one guy to an island with you and you knew you'd be safe because he was the best man and he was going to figure out how to survive, he was going to make everything... make the world a good place on the island, he was going to keep you happy, he... this is the best man for the job, no matter what, if it was between me and your father, - who would you say? - My daddy. I don't see... hang on a second. Hang on a second. Listen. I think you're wrong about that. It's your choice to make, but I want you to understand something: That there's a lot of... hey. Pick up... what hap... what is that? You can't leave your fishing rod like that. I don't know why the hell it keeps dripping. All night long... drip, drip, drip. I've had the fucking thing repaired ten times. You need a new stopper. Is that it? Your stopper's... it's rotted all around the edges, so it's not making a seal. The water's going to drip through to the bowl. I could, uh... I could bring you a new one tomorrow. Or you might want to consider replacing the whole apparatus. What do you recommend? I could replace the stopper first. If that doesn't work, I could replace the whole apparatus. You can't give me a professional recommendation? It's really up to you. Tomorrow my sister-in-law's coming over with the nephews. I got to take the car in. No, it's my sister jeanine's oldest daughter's bat mitzvah. I'm looking forward to being bored to death. The girl doesn't want it, her father doesn't want it, and don't even ask me.",

Well, it's awkward because he's literally, like, cleaning the shit out of my toilet bowl right now, and I don't think I'm at my most alluring. Yeah, maybe you're right. It's not like I met him socially. Okay, thank you, Cindy. Okay. Like 20 minutes. Bye. Uh, hi. All set. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Can I give you a tip? You mean like a suggestion? No. I mean like a tip. Oh. Okay. Thank you. - Okay. - Okay. Good night. Good night. Goodbye. I mean, how many times do I have to fix these fucking pipes? Every time I take a shower, the entire apartment has a flood. It's driving me insane. Well, I'll get you a plumber here tomorrow, but I'd say we're going to have to break through the tile and isolate the leak because there's quite a lot of water down there. How do you know it's me? Why is it automatically me? Because if it was coming from higher up, you'd have water damage in your ceiling or in your wall, and it's all dry. Great. It might just be the caulking. This whole tub needs to be recaulked. Have you taken a bath or a shower in the last couple of hours? Yes. It might just be that. Okay. And how are you planning to find that out? Well, we could run the shower and see if it drips downstairs. Oh, you want me to take a shower right now? No. You want me to take a shower right now while you stand there watching to see if it drips into the Fredrichs' apartment? I don't give a fuck what you do, Mrs. Olsen. I'm just trying to fix the fucking leak. I... I didn't like that. How dare you talk to me like that. Get the fuck out of my fucking house. Okay. Get the fuck out of my fucking house before I call the police. All right. Did you hear me? I said get out. I can't. You're blocking the doorway. What the fuck's the matter with you? You can't talk to the tenants like that. Look, Lee, you do good work. You're dependable. But I get these complaints all the time. You're rude, you're unfriendly.",

We spoke on the phone. - Yeah, hi. - I'm very, very sorry. - Thank you. - Hello, George. - Hiya, Jim. - How you holding up? Oh, great, you know - It's a very sad day. - Yeah. Where's my brother? Oh, he's downstairs. You can see him if you want. What happened to him? Just a cardiac arrest. You know his heart's very weak at this point. It just gave out. I'm really sorry you couldn't get here in time, but as I told you before... aw, fuck this. Sorry. - That's okay, buddy. - That's perfectly all right. Did anybody call my uncle? It's their uncle Donny. Yeah, my aunt and uncle. - Somebody should have called... - no, Lee. Lee, no. - What? What? - Donny got a job in Minnesota. - Like, a while ago. - Minnesota? Yeah, he got a job in some outfit in minnetonka, Minnesota, if you can believe that. - Joe didn't tell you about that? - No. I can call him if you want, Lee, and tell him what happened. - Okay, thanks. - No problem. Tell him what happened. Tell him I'll call him tonight. Talk about arrangements. Somebody should call my wife. - Your, uh, uh... - Ex-wife. - You mean Randi? - Randi. - Yes, I'm sorry.

But most people suffer periodic episodes, like the one you had on Monday, which mimic the symptoms of a heart attack, and which further weaken the muscle. They can put you out of commission for a week, two weeks. And you'll need to be hospitalized so we can monitor your heart, because the risk of cardiac arrest is elevated for a week or two. - Oh, my god. - It's okay.

Nope. - Elise, let me get you a glass of water. - No. - Daddy, forget it. - Forget it like you. Everybody should be just like you. You know what? I am tired of being the bad guy here. Jesus Christ!

You sound better. So did you guys actually use the fishing tackle? Oh, yeah. Patty caught a humongous bluefish... 18 pounds. Oh, yeah? Well, that's awesome. Oh, I never seen anybody so happy in my whole life. Oh, its nice in here. You keep it nice. Wow. - What a homemaker. - Fuck off. All right. Get away from me. Stop it. Oh, don't. Stop. Please, I'm sick. Okay. For real, get off of me. - Hi, Stanny. - Oh, god, let him alone. - How come you're not crying? - I just got him settled. - What did you get him settled for? - Lee, don't pick him up. If he's not crying, leave well enough alone. Leave well enough alone. That's what me and your mommy should have done instead of getting married. Oh, shut up. Then you wouldn't be here. Your sisters wouldn't be here, and I could watch the football game in my own living room with peace and quiet. You know what? You can go fuck yourself. Oh, jeez Louise. Hey, kiddo. Oh, my gosh. You're very handsome, you know that? See that? I didn't make him cry. Up and down. Yeah. He's not crying... 'Cause I know how to handle him."

It just needs a minute to warm up. What year did you get this thing, 1928? Where's the horse that goes with this fucking car? Maybe he can breathe on us. Patty, I swear to god. I know. Why don't we keep my dad in here for the next three months? You'd save a fucking fortune. Would you shut the fuck up about the freezer? Want me to have a nervous breakdown because there's undertakers and a funeral? - Who cares? - No. I don't. Okay, it's getting warmer. I got band practice. Can you drive me home so I can get my stuff and take me over to my girlfriend's house? Sure. This the same girl who was over at the house? No. That was Sylvie, and this is Sandy. They don't know about each other, so, uh, please don't say anything in case it comes up. I won't. Do you actually have sex with these girls? We don't just play computer games. With both of them? Well, with Sandy's mom here, it's sort of, uh, strictly just like basement business. What does that mean? It means I'm working on it. Stop. Otto, man, what are you doing? What did I do? You're way behind, man. No, I'm not. You're a little behind, Otto. You got to stay with the bass, Otto. Come on, man, just stay with me, all right? - Let's go. - All right, I'm sorry. All right. Yeah. Come on. It's all right. Come on, let's go. - All right, guys. - Let's go again. Otto, you good? - You good, buddy? - Let's go, baby. We are Stentorian. 123 Hi. Are you Lee? I'm Jill, Sandy's mom. I think they're wrapping up. You want to come inside and have a beer or something? It's all right. Thank you. I wanted to offer my condolences about Joe.",

Patrick is one of my favorite people. That's good. How's it goin' up there, you guys? It's going... It's going fine, thanks! But we're right in the middle of something. We're just banging out those compound fractions. At least we know where they are, right? That's true. How many of those you generally gotta go through before you pick a winner? I'd like to see you use one of these goddamn things with all these interruptions. Oh, fuck me! What happened? Are you ok? I tripped over your fuckin' doll house. Oh my god, did you break it? I don't know. I'm fine though, by the way. Oh my god. My grandmother gave me that when I was five years old. It was literally her doll house from when she was a little girl. Then what's it doin' on the fuckin' floor? Um, it's a doll house, that's where you play with it! Kids, what is going on up there? Nothing! Patrick just stubbed his toe on mummer's doll house, but it's okay! Sandy, that doll house belonged to my mother. - Yes I know, mom. - If you're gonna smash it to pieces... Nobody is smashin' it to pieces! It's fine! Don't worry, Jill, I'm okay. My toe's gonna be okay. Do you want to fuck me or not? Yes. Could I get you another beer, Lee? I'm good. Thank you. Would you excuse me, Lee, one sec? Sure. - Is it on? - Yes. It's a miracle. Okay, hurry up. Ow... One second please! Get outta my way! I'm sorry. What's up? I'm really sorry, I know you're trying to work, but I can't sit down there much longer. Why? What's the problem? He won't talk. I've been trying to make conversation for half an hour. - Are you serious? - What's the matter? I realize I'm not the most fascinating - person in the world... - oh, mom! But it's very, very strained. - What's going on? - She can't get your uncle to talk. He likes sports. I'm sorry to bust things up, but how much longer do you think you're gonna be?"
