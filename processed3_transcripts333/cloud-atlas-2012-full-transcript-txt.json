One voice different... One voice, whisperin' out there, spyin' from the dark. That fangy devil, Ol' Georgie hisself. Now you hear up close, and I'll yarn you about the first time we met, eye to eye. And thus it was when I made the acquaintance of Dr. Henry Goose, the man I hoped might cure me of my affliction. Have you lost something? Question one. What secret in Sixsmith's report would be worth killing him for? Question two. Is it reasonable to believe that they would kill again to protect that secret? And if so, question three. What the fuck am I doing here? While my extensive experience as an editor has lead me to a disdain for flashbacks and flash forwards, and all such tricksy gimmicks, I believe that if you, dear reader, can extend your patience for a just a moment, you will find there is a method to this tale of madness. My dearest Sixsmith I shot myself through the roof of my mouth this morning with Vyvyan Ayrs' Luger. A true suicide is a paced, disciplined certainty. People pontificate \"suicide is a coward's act\". Couldn't be further from the truth. Suicide takes tremendous courage. Any problem sir, you just hit this button. Thank you. On behalf of my Ministry, and the future of Unanimity, I would like to thank you for this final interview. – Hello. – Press pass. Expecting trouble? I was Dermot Hoggins' publisher, not his shrink or his astrologer, and the ruddy bloody truth is, I had no idea what the man was gonna do that night. This beach was once a cannibal's banqueting hall, where the strong gorged on the weak, but the teeth, sir, they spat out, like you and I would expel a cherry stone. Do you know the price a quarter pound of these will earn? Remember this is not an interrogation or a trial. Your version of the truth is all that matters. Truth is singular.

Future generations depend on men like him men capable of speaking the truth. Quite. When I first encountered Haskell Moore's writing, its perspicuity struck me as though delivered through divine revelation. The learned doctor here and I have already spent many a night debating Mr. Moore's tractus. I'm only willing to concede that he makes a compelling case as to why we are sitting here, enjoying this divine lamb, while Kupaka stands there, content to serve. Indeed, ain'it. Kupaka... you enjoy your life here with us, do you not? Oh yes, Reverend, sir. Kupaka very happy here. You see this is Moore's ladder of civilization. The reason behind this natural order... Please Giles, do shut up. I've been listening to this for weeks, I... would love to know what his own son-in-law has to say about it. Well let's see... It is an inquiry concerning God's will and the nature of men. And what does he have to say about the nature of women? I'm afraid that's a subject he prefers to pass by in silence. He wouldn't be the first. Pray, Mr. Ewing, continue. Well... the question he does pose is... if God created the world, how do we know what things we can change, and what things must remain sacred and inviolable? Reverend Horrox is real specific how to run plantation. Georgian way best way he say. God, this heat is unbearable. How do they take it? Reverend Horrox say slaves like camel, bred for desert. He say... they not feel heat like civilized folk. Now we should get you out of the sun. Now what... what is that noise? – There you are. – What happened? It is as I suspected. Gusano Coco Cervello, better known as the Polynesian worm. Once saw a man's brain after the worm had finished with him... maggoty cauliflower. But have no fear, this particular devil and I... are well acquainted. Here we go. Ah, yes, yes, all gone. - I don't know what I would have done had our paths not crossed. Well for starters, you would have died. I shall find a way to repay you. Unnecessary I assure you. I am a doctor, Adam. A tiger cannot change its stripes. CAMBRIDGE, 1936 Sixsmith, I do hope you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me.",

Please, comply. A letter is being drafted to your father sir. Mr. Frobisher! Hated leaving you like that. Wasn't the goodbye I had in mind. By the time you read this, I will be on my way to Edinburgh, on my way to fame and fortune. I know you haven't heard of him, but trust me, Vyvyan Ayrs is one of the musical greats, Sixsmith. The tragedy is that he hasn't produced any new work in years due to illness. My scheme is to persuade him to hire me as his amanuensis, and aid him in the creation of a masterpiece, before shooting up through the musical firmament, eventually obliging Pater to admit that yes, the son he disinherited is none other than Robert Frobisher, the greatest British composer of his time. I know, Sixsmith, you groan and shake your head, but you smile too, which is why I love you. P.S.: Thanks for the waistcoat. I needed something of yours to keep me company. St. George and the Dragon. Reminds me that composing is a crusade. Sometimes you slay the dragon, sometimes the dragon slays you. Alright then. Frobisher is it? I trust Mackerras taught you enough to be useful. I've had this little melody for viola rattling about my head for months, let's see if you can get it down. Subtle grace note before the third. Soft and simple. Got it? Now it gets interesting. Good. Play that back. Would love to sir. What key are we in? What key? G minor, of course. And the time signature? For Christ's sake, did you hear it or not? – Just... just need a little more time. – You need? My dear boy, who is working for whom here? – I apologize, sir... – Are you an amanuensis or an apologist? Now pay attention. Three-four, changes to four-four on fourth bar and back to three-four on bar five, if you can count that high. Crotchet G, pause for a quaver, repeat G quaver, then E-flat on the down beat. And so on. Alright let me hear it. Stop please! You're hurting me! You must have misheard me, I said I had a melody not a malady! Vyvyan... Jocasta, deliver me! – What's going on in here? – An exercise in futility. Should I be introduced? There's really no point, the boy is as useful as the clap.",

And we're still here. That's a very peculiar birthmark. Yeah. My little comet. My mother was sure it was cancer, she wanted me to get it removed, but... don't know. I kinda like it. I knew someone who had a birthmark that was... – similar to that. – Really? Who was it? Someone I cared about very much. A hypothetical question for you, Miss Rey. As a journalist, what price would you pay to protect a source? Any. Prison? If it came to that. Yes. Would you be prepared to... compromise your safety? My father braved booby-trapped marshes and the wrath of generals for his journalistic integrity. What kind of daughter would I be if I bailed when things got a little tough? Saved. Taxi! – You sure you don't need a cab? – No, I've got my car. Well, you know if... there's ever something I can do for you, please give me a call."

I need help. I need £ 50,000, not 2,000, 50,000! I'm going through it again, Mr. Cavendish, but the total's right. 2,343 pounds and 16 pence. How is this possible? The ruddy money was pouring in. Debts mostly, Mr. Cavendish. Solvency has its drawbacks. The situation looked dire, but I knew that Timothy Cavendish's capital in this town could not be defined by an accountant's balance sheet! McCluskie! Look, how are those delightful kiddies of yours? Mon cher, tis \"Cavendish the Ravenous,\" your favorite Timothy. Mon cher? You heard correctly, Charles Dickens' own original authentic writing desk for £ 60,000. I think that's very fair. But our records indicate that the desk is already accounted for by the Dickens House Museum.",

      "raw_text": "They think the Devil lives up there. I can't find anybody to guide me through the Kona territory. Meronym... Every day you're out there you increase your rad levels. This dream of yours is going to kill you. And for what? The Off-World colonies may no longer exist. I got to go Captain. Thank you for coming. I'm in 1404. I'll be right up. Dr. Sixsmith? It's Luisa. Go call the police. Right now. Call the police! My dear Sixsmith, you alone can understand how I'm feeling right now. Today, Ayrs and I presented our first collaboration to Tadeusz Kesselring Ayrs favorite conductor who arrived from Berlin. It's called \"Eternal Recurrence\". Wish you could hear it. It's the most accomplished tone poem I know of written since the war and I tell you Sixsmith, that more than of the few of its best ideas are mine. At our time of life, Ayrs, a man has no right to such daring ideas. I suppose I've won a rearguard action or two in my war against decrepitude. Dinner of pheasant with Bordeaux rich as buttercream. How I love to listen to men of distinguished lives, sing of past follies and glories. The only broken note in the entire evening was Ayrs wife, Jocasta, excusing herself early. Sensed a buried bone. Later I asked Ayrs about it. He said Kesselring had introduced Jocasta to him. I pried, had Kesselring been in love with her? The subject was a prickly one. Jocasta is a Jew. Obviously a relationship was impossible. Why obviously? Can you really be so ignorant of what is happening in Germany? At this point in my life, all I know, Sixsmith, is that this world spins from the same unseen forces that twist our hearts. – How's it, Mr. Zachry? – Same always. – Mindin' some company? – Nay.

        "They think the Devil lives up there. I can't find anybody to guide me through the Kona territory. Meronym... Every day you're out there you increase your rad levels. This dream of yours is going to kill you. And for what? The Off-World colonies may no longer exist. I got to go Captain. Thank you for coming. I'm in 1404. I'll be right up. Dr. Sixsmith? It's Luisa. Go call the police. Right now. Call the police! My dear Sixsmith, you alone can understand how I'm feeling right now. Today, Ayrs and I presented our first collaboration to Tadeusz Kesselring Ayrs favorite conductor who arrived from Berlin. It's called \"Eternal Recurrence\". Wish you could hear it. It's the most accomplished tone poem I know of written since the war and I tell you Sixsmith, that more than of the few of its best ideas are mine. At our time of life, Ayrs, a man has no right to such daring ideas. I suppose I've won a rearguard action or two in my war against decrepitude. Dinner of pheasant with Bordeaux rich as buttercream. How I love to listen to men of distinguished lives, sing of past follies and glories. The only broken note in the entire evening was Ayrs wife, Jocasta, excusing herself early. Sensed a buried bone. Later I asked Ayrs about it. He said Kesselring had introduced Jocasta to him. I pried, had Kesselring been in love with her? The subject was a prickly one. Jocasta is a Jew. Obviously a relationship was impossible. Why obviously? Can you really be so ignorant of what is happening in Germany? At this point in my life, all I know, Sixsmith, is that this world spins from the same unseen forces that twist our hearts. – How's it, Mr. Zachry? – Same always. – Mindin' some company? – Nay. But... Goats, and sodowise herders, ain't known for our housin' temper. Feelin' that I owin' you a real kowtow, for invadin' your house with no sayso. True sorrysome. Well then... Done is done. So, you mindin' a stranger queryin' about your drivin'? Swap you. Query for query. Fair buy. Cog you and come to learn stitchin' n' milkin' our herdin'. Why you here? I needin' a guide. Guide?

The Old Uns and Valleymen prayin' to Sonmi, not cisely the same? Old men... they were different. Different- How? You want the true-true? This is where you live? This... is where Union was born."

In your Revelations, you spoke of the consequences of an individual's life rippling throughout eternity. Does this mean that you believe in an afterlife? In a heaven or hell? I believe death is only a door. When its closes, another opens. If I can't imagine heaven, I would imagine a door opening. And behind it, I will find him there, waiting for me. My love. Oh God, I missed you so much. Thank you sir. If I may ask one last question... You had to know this Union scheme was doomed to fail. Yes. Then why did you agree to it? This is what general Apis asked of me. What, to be executed? If I had remained invisible, the truth would stay hidden. I couldn't allow that. And what if no one believes this truth? Someone already does. Adam, good God... I have just been recounting your astonishing adventure. Please, join us. Give him a chair. No no, thank you. I cannot stay. What are you doing here? I thought the doctor said at least three weeks in bed? He did, but this couldn't wait. I need to speak with you sir. Privately. Of course. Is that the contract the from Reverend Horrox? – It is indeed. – Well, you know I could have sent a boy. Are you insane?! I owe my life to a self-freed slave. And I cannot in good conscience participate in this kind of business any longer. This would make such a good book. I'll drink to that. Outside, fat snow flakes are falling on slate roofs and granite walls. Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont, I shall beaver away in exile. Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone. Goddamn you, sir, if you were not my daughter's husband... Hello Father. Tilda? What is going on? Ive come to say goodbye. Goodbye? Where are you going?

        "From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, rebirth our future. In your Revelations, you spoke of the consequences of an individual's life rippling throughout eternity. Does this mean that you believe in an afterlife? In a heaven or hell? I believe death is only a door. When its closes, another opens. If I can't imagine heaven, I would imagine a door opening. And behind it, I will find him there, waiting for me. My love. Oh God, I missed you so much. Thank you sir. If I may ask one last question... You had to know this Union scheme was doomed to fail. Yes. Then why did you agree to it? This is what general Apis asked of me. What, to be executed? If I had remained invisible, the truth would stay hidden. I couldn't allow that. And what if no one believes this truth? Someone already does. Adam, good God... I have just been recounting your astonishing adventure. Please, join us. Give him a chair. No no, thank you. I cannot stay. What are you doing here? I thought the doctor said at least three weeks in bed? He did, but this couldn't wait. I need to speak with you sir. Privately. Of course. Is that the contract the from Reverend Horrox? – It is indeed. – Well, you know I could have sent a boy. Are you insane?! I owe my life to a self-freed slave. And I cannot in good conscience participate in this kind of business any longer. This would make such a good book. I'll drink to that. Outside, fat snow flakes are falling on slate roofs and granite walls. Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont, I shall beaver away in exile. Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone. Goddamn you, sir, if you were not my daughter's husband... Hello Father. Tilda? What is going on? Ive come to say goodbye. Goodbye? Where are you going? We're moving back East, to work with the abolitionists. What? That poison has rotted your brain. Well if it has I highly recommend it. I've not felt this good in years.
