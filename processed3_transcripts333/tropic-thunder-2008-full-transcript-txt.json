Here they come! - Kirk, no! - Stop tailgating me, you pasty teabag! Can I make pee-pee? - The planes are inbound! - I know! Oh, shit! Get the fruit... Jesus! Fuck! Shit! Cocksucking! - That's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go! - Tropic tits! Goddamn shit-picking cock! It's beautiful! Mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot! Fuck! - Sweet. - Oh, mama! Let me down! Bungle in the jungle. More bad news from the Vietnamese set of Tropic Thunder, where a $4 million explosion charred the Asian location and the camera wasn't even rolling. Financed by hotheaded mega-mogul Les Grossman, the film is already rumored to be one month behind schedule just five days into shooting. The reason? Fingers are pointed at rookie director Damien Cockburn, who, insiders say, can't control a star-studded cast, including flatulent star of the popular Fatties franchise, Jeff Portnoy. Let me tell you something. A lot of people are disrespecting me. They say that the movie's just about farts. It's about family, and... you! You can't do what I do. Fresh from his most recent arrest for heroin, glue and crack possession, Portnoy was almost uninsurable. Also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking hip-hop hyphenate Alpa Chino. I'm so excited, you know what I'm saying, about doing Tropic Thunder. Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby. Drink Booty Sweat. But the real heavyweight on the set is five-time Academy Award winner Kirk Lazarus. The brilliant Australian known for his bad boy antics off-screen is famous for his total immersion into any role he portrays. Well, being an actor is no different Well, being an actor is no different than being a rugby player or a construction worker, save for the fact that my tools are the mechanisms that trigger human emotion. Lazarus underwent a controversial pigmentation alteration procedure in order to play the platoon's African-American sergeant, Lincoln Osiris. Yeah! Trying to hold his own onscreen with Kirk is action juggernaut Tugg Speedman. Once the highest grossing star in the world, lately his Scorcher films have lost their heat. Recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra. You have no real family.",

        "Where is it? - Now it's time to flip the script! - Kirk... Be here till Chinese New Year waiting for my man to cry. Here they come! - Kirk, no! - Stop tailgating me, you pasty teabag! Can I make pee-pee? - The planes are inbound! - I know! Oh, shit! Get the fruit... Jesus! Fuck! Shit! Cocksucking! - That's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go! - Tropic tits! Goddamn shit-picking cock! It's beautiful! Mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot! Fuck! - Sweet. - Oh, mama! Let me down! Bungle in the jungle. More bad news from the Vietnamese set of Tropic Thunder, where a $4 million explosion charred the Asian location and the camera wasn't even rolling. Financed by hotheaded mega-mogul Les Grossman, the film is already rumored to be one month behind schedule just five days into shooting. The reason? Fingers are pointed at rookie director Damien Cockburn, who, insiders say, can't control a star-studded cast, including flatulent star of the popular Fatties franchise, Jeff Portnoy. Let me tell you something. A lot of people are disrespecting me. They say that the movie's just about farts. It's about family, and... you! You can't do what I do. Fresh from his most recent arrest for heroin, glue and crack possession, Portnoy was almost uninsurable. Also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking hip-hop hyphenate Alpa Chino. I'm so excited, you know what I'm saying, about doing Tropic Thunder. Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby. Drink Booty Sweat. But the real heavyweight on the set is five-time Academy Award winner Kirk Lazarus. The brilliant Australian known for his bad boy antics off-screen is famous for his total immersion into any role he portrays. Well, being an actor is no different Well, being an actor is no different than being a rugby player or a construction worker, save for the fact that my tools are the mechanisms that trigger human emotion. Lazarus underwent a controversial pigmentation alteration procedure in order to play the platoon's African-American sergeant, Lincoln Osiris. Yeah! Trying to hold his own onscreen with Kirk is action juggernaut Tugg Speedman. Once the highest grossing star in the world, lately his Scorcher films have lost their heat. Recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra. You have no real family."

Damn. Four Leaf, since you're the staff sergeant, there's the map, this is the scene list. Think you can handle it? We have rigged this entire valley of death with hidden cameras. And I will be shooting as well, from unseen vantage points, so that every glorious moment is captured on film. And believe me, gentlemen, it will be glorious. If it looks real, chances are it probably is. You wanted to be actors. You wanted to occupy the skin of another human being. Well, get ready to occupy the skin of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt, surrounded by death, crawling up Satan's bottom. There'll be ambushes, enemy fire, your own little personal slice of 'Nam. This radio goes to the chopper and the chopper only. The chopper is God, and I am Jesus Christ, his son. You are my chosen disciples. And no one gets to go home till we get the shots. Put on your war faces, gentlemen. Now, let's go and make the greatest war movie ever! - Yeah! - All right! Yeah! Yeah! Not bad, Cockburn! Not bad. Wherever you are! Wherever he is? Looks like he's all over the place. Here we go. Must be an old French mine. It's a remnant from colonial Indo-China. This jungle must be full of them. Don't you get it? He's messing with our heads. That's what all that playing God stuff was about. He's trying to get us to act good, save the movie. He ain't playing God. He's being judged by him. That's our objective. Complete the mission. No offense, Kirk, I know you're the big fancy actor here, but I've done a lot more effects-driven event films than you. Okay? And I think I can spot a prop head when I see one. Oh, Jesus. It's corn syrup, guys. Corn syrup and latex. Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup. Oh, God. Smoke and mirrors, guys. Welcome to the movie factory. Oldest trick in the book. He getting down now. Oh, my God! Whoa, look at me! You're going to get the shots, and I'm going to make sure because I'm the director. I'm from London. I direct plays. Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!",
