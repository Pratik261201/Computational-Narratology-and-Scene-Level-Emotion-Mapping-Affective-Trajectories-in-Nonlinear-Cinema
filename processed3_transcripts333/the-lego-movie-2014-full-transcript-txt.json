        "Of course, buddy. I believe you. Great. I \"believe\" you too. You see the quotations I'm making with my claw hands? It means I don't believe you! Why else would you show up with that thing on your back... just three days before President Business... is going to use the Kragle to end the world? President Business is gonna end the world? But he's such a good guy. And Octan, they make good stuff. Music, dairy products, coffee, TV shows... surveillance systems, all history books, voting machines. Wait a minute. Come on, you can't be this stupid. This is a misunderstanding. I'm just a regular, normal, ordinary guy. I'm late to meet my best friends in the whole world. They're probably missing me right now. They're probably out looking around. \"Hey, where's Emmet? Hey, where's my best friend Emmet?\" Hey, you know what? Ask all my friends. They'll tell you. Oh, we asked them, all right. Boom! That guy's not a criminal mastermind. See? Yeah. You know, he's kind of an average, normal kind of guy. Thank you. But, you know, he's not, like... normal like us. No. He's not that special. Wait, I'm so confused. Who are we talking about? Wait, does he work with us? Gail doesn't remember me? Look at Randy here. He likes sausage. That's something. Gail is perky. That's something. And Harry... - well... - When you say Harry, I go: When you say the other guy, I go: Harry's the best! - Harry's got personality. - He's weird! He's weird! I know that guy but I know, like, zippy-zap about him. We just talked earlier. I mean, all he does is say yes... to everything everybody else is doing. You know, he's just sort of a \"\" Little bit of a blank slate, I guess. That'll be $42, please. We all have something that makes us something and Emmet is... nothing. There you go. - I told you I was a nobody. - Oh. It's the perfect cover. Cover? Cover for what? I can't break him. Take him to the melting chamber. What? You're gonna melt me? Am I gonna die? You'll live. You'll be fine. President Business. I have him right here, sir. Yes, we've told him he'll live so he doesn't try to escape, but... we're lying to him. Wait, what did he just say? Hold still. Wait! There's obviously been a mix-up here. You've got the wrong... That is gonna start hurting... pretty soon. No, no, no! Who are you?"

A house divided against itself would be better... than this. Abraham Lincoln! You bring your space chair right back here! Come on, guys! We can still do this. Right? You're not even a bit special. Well, you were right about him being a ding-dong. You're a huge disappointment. Get him out of here. I don't wanna look at him. Well, at least it can't get any worse. I was wrong. It's the Orb of Tee-ti-list! It's the bad guys. How did he...? Go! Run! Come on, everyone! Protect The Special. What's that on his ankle? It's a tracking device. Take the MasterBuilders prisoner. Oh, he led them right to us. Guys, no, no, no. It's not my fault. You are the worst leader I've ever seen. To the Batmobile! Dang it. To the invisible jet! - Dang it! - Every man for himself. No, we must protect the Piece. Shaq, do you know what time... - it is? - It's game time. Y'all ready for this? Oh, no! They were ready for that. It didn't break! Because it's Kragled. Machine gum! Fire! No! I can't move! Don't worry, Superman. - I'll get you out of there. - No! Don't! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck. My legs are stuck as well. I super hate you. - You're pulling my torso off. - Babe... help me get him out of here. I said \"every man for himself.\" Hey, you gotta be there for me. Fine! Fine. Fine. Fine. - I need you to have a better attitude. - I have a great... attitude. The Special's in the northwest quadrant. We've got him cornered. Where'd he go? Oh, no! They've hit our silly cloud stabilizers! Let's go! We need to get Emmet out of here. - Can't we build something? - Hey! I'm Ben. But you can call me Benny. I can build a spaceship. Watch. Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship Spaceship, spaceship No! You can't. The skies are surrounded. That's okay. I didn't really wanna build... a spaceship anyway. That's cool. Where can we go where we can't be found? Maybe we could go underwater? What if we went underwater? Great idea, babe! Thank you, Batman. Your ideas are the best. But I just said that. - We could build a submarine. - A Bat-Submarine, patent pending. With rainbows! And dream catchers, in case we take a nap. Like an underwater spaceship! But you can't build all of them at once."

Like you always do. Didn't you hear him? The prophecy's made-up. I'm not The Special. And to think for a moment I thought I might be. - Emmet. - Who said that? I did. I am Ghost Vitruvius. Emmet, you didn't let me finish earlier. Because I died. The reason I made up the prophecy... was because I knew that whoever found the Piece... could become The Special. Because the only thing anyone needs to be special... is to believe that you can be. I know that sounds like a cat poster, but it's true. Look at what you did when you believed you were special.",

Now, where is my X-Acto knife? I gotta get the Piece of Resistance. If I could get the attention of the smaller creature. . I gotta move. Where is that? Move! All right. Move! Now, I didn't move... - Dad? - Yeah. I think I saw the X-Acto over there near Middle Zealand. Oh, great. Thank you. Welcome. It's up to you now, Emmet. Believe. I know that sounds like a cat poster... but it's true. Sorry, street. Ho-ho! I can see everything. What the heck is this? I am a MasterBuilder. Release every Micro-manager we have! Let's get him, fellas! Hey, everyone! - Emmet! - Emmet! Yay! Lucy, I'm going inside that thing. You've got it, Emmet. Take that! Good night! Come here! We'll help you out, kid. Here's how we do it pirate-style! Yes! Emmet! That's it! Take him down, boys! Emmet! Stay positive. They're tearing me apart! Stay positive. Come on! Oh, forget it! You all need to be more friendly! Emmet, go! Go! Now's your... - chance! - She's right! - You can do it, me laddie! - Go on, kid. Get in there! Sir, we got an intrud...! Lord Business. Back from the dead, Brickowski? Well, you're too late! Skeletrons, get him! I can't move! You see, your friends... oh, they're finished! My world is almost finished. The last thing I need to do is finish..."
