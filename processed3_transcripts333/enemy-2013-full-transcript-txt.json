Let's get together again. I love you. Control. It's all about control. Every dictatorship has one obsession. And that's it. So, in ancient Rome, they gave the people bread and circuses. They kept the populace busy with entertainment. But other dictatorships use other strategies to control ideas. The knowledge. How do they do that? Lower education. They limit culture. Censor information. They censor any means of individual expression. And it's important to remember this, that this is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history. Okay. See you next week. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? I'm good. See, every dictatorship, there's only one obsession and that's control, they want to have control over the people. In ancient Rome, they gave bread and circuses, they kept the populace busy with entertainment. In other dictatorships, they have other strategies. To limit information, to limit ideas and knowledge. How do they do that? They lower education, limit culture. They censor any means of self-expression. But it's important to remember this, this is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history. You don't go to the movies, do you? Movies? Yeah, are you a movie guy? In your free time, I mean? I don't know, I don't go out that much, I don't really like movies. Oh. You don't have to go out to enjoy a good flick at home. That's true. I usually just rent them. Most people don't these days, but it's what I do. Is there a reason why you're asking me this? No. 'Cause you brought it up and I thought, you know, maybe you had a recommendation, or you saw a movie that you liked and you want to tell me about it. Oh, sure, I mean, there's always something. - I could go for something cheerful. - Hmm. Where There's a Will There's a Way. It's true. No, it's a movie, I saw it a little while ago, but, um... I remember, I liked it. Hmm. Where There's a Will There's a Way. Yeah, that's it. Local film, if you... I'll keep it in mind. I think I'm drunk. You wanna go to bed? Hmm? You wanna go to bed? No, I'm gonna finish grading these papers and then I'll come join you, okay? Mr. Henderson, my husband will be back.",

I told you, like, two days ago. The organic blueberries. Not the conventional blueberries. I can't use 'em in the shake. What's wrong? I wasn't... Only I was saying 'cause I read it in a magazine that blueberries, the organic ones are better than conventional ones... Are you gonna tell me what's wrong? I... I went to... I went to see that guy. Who? What're you talking about? The guy on the phone. I went to his work. Why did you do that? That's dangerous, honey. I wanted to know. Are you okay? He had the same voice. He looks exactly like you. What do you mean, \"Exactly like me\"? What's happening? I don't... Really don't know what you're talking about. I think you know. I think you know. Hello? I told you. - Show me your hands, man. - Why? Come on, show me your hands. Maybe we're brothers. We're not... We're not brothers. We're not brothers. How do you know? Do you have a... Do you have a scar on your chest? This one? You do, don't you? I, uh... - When's your birthday? - This was a bad idea. I think I made a mistake here. Um... I have a... I have this. I went to...

I know a place called the Breezeway Inn. It's about an hour outside the city. Do you know where that is? No. All right. Well, then I'll call you on Sunday with directions. 1:00, okay? Okay. All right. Uh-huh. - Well, see you soon. - Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you soon. Hello. Hi. Is everything all right? How many months are you? Uh... Six. That's nice. I should be going. I have a class, I have to teach in it. Ah... Never know how your day is gonna turn out. Have a nice day. What's up, honey? Hello? Hello? Hi. It is a scorcher out there. The last 10 minutes of my run, this 22-year-old kid or something like that, he was... He was following me the whole time. Never gonna beat this kid. And he dropped. Do you think that I should cut my beard off 'cause it's fucking hot? Wait, why did you call me earlier? Did you call me for a reason? Honey, where are the blueberries? Where are the blueberries? I told you, like, two days ago. The organic blueberries. Not the conventional blueberries. I can't use 'em in the shake. What's wrong? I wasn't... Only I was saying 'cause I read it in a magazine that blueberries, the organic ones are better than conventional ones... Are you gonna tell me what's wrong? I... I went to... I went to see that guy. Who? What're you talking about? The guy on the phone. I went to his work. Why did you do that? That's dangerous, honey. I wanted to know. Are you okay? He had the same voice. He looks exactly like you. What do you mean, \"Exactly like me\"? What's happening? I don't... Really don't know what you're talking about. I think you know. I think you know. Hello? I told you. - Show me your hands, man. - Why? Come on, show me your hands. Maybe we're brothers. We're not... We're not brothers. We're not brothers. How do you know? Do you have a... Do you have a scar on your chest? This one? You do, don't you? I, uh... - When's your birthday? - This was a bad idea. I think I made a mistake here. Um... I have a... I have this. I went to... The company that represents you, they gave that to me... To you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't worry, honey. That guy won't be calling here again. Fuck. There must be some difference."
