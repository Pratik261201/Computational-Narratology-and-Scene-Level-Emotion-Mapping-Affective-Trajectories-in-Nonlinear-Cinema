Okay, um, just, I have to keep my hands on the wheel. (CONTINUES GRUNTING) Excuse me. Whoo! (CHUCKLES) Ah, Dopinder. Pool. Dead. Hmm, nice. DOPINDER: Smells good, no? Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl. Ah, yes. Gita. - Hmm. - She is quite lovely. She would have made me a very agreeable wife. But, um... Gita's heart has been stolen by my cousin Bandhu. He is as dishonorable as he is attractive. Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's a reason I'm in this cab today. Yeah, sir, you called for it, remember? No, my slender brown friend. Love is a beautiful thing. When you find it, the whole world tastes like Daffodil Daydream. (DOPINDER GRUNTS) So you gotta hold onto love... - ...tight! - Ah. And never let go. Don't make the same mistakes I did. - Got it? - Yeah. Or else the whole world tastes like Mama June after hot yoga. (STUTTERS) Sir, what does Miss Mama June taste like? Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss. Okay, enough. I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is, it's bad! Hmm, it's bad. Uh, why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool? Oh, that's because it's Christmas Day, Dopinder. And I'm after someone on my naughty list. I've been waiting one year, three weeks... six days and, oh... 14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me. And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool? This shit... Boo! (CHOPPER BLADES WHIRRING) (SIGHS) They won't disappoint. They'd better not. And what about next month's shipment? There won't be one. You're not the only one with a war to win. That won't do. See, we've had this small disruption to our supply chain... (CHOKING) We'd appreciate your patience. (GRUNTS) Okay. We'll deliver in full the following month. (GASPING) Pleasure doing business with you. Fucking mutant. (ENGINES ROARING) Oh, shit! I forgot my ammo bag. Shall we turn back? No, no time. Fuck it. I got this. 9, 10, 11, 12 bullets, or bust. Right here! (TYRES SCREECHING) That's, uh, $27.50. I... I never carry a wallet when I'm working. Ruins the lines of my suit. - Oh. - But, uh, how about a crisp high five? Okay. Merry Christmas. And a convivial Tuesday in April to you too, Pool! ♪ Hey, yeah I wanna shoop, baby WADE: (SINGING) ♪ Shoop shooop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop ♪ Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop ♪ You're packed and you're stacked 'specially in the back ♪ Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that ♪ Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie?",

Threats hurt, Jer. Though not nearly as badly as serrated steel. So keep away from Meghan. Cool? Yes. Yes, sir. Then we're done. Wait. (CHUCKLES SLOWLY) We are? - Yeah. We're totally done. - (MERCHANT LAUGHS) You should've seen your face. I didn't know what to do. I was so scared. Soft spot, remember?

You've heard the last of Jeremy. He's sorry. No friggin' way. Should've brought my roller blades. Show these kids how it's done. Oh. And that's why we do it. But mostly the money. Hey, think you could fuck up my step-dad? I give a guy a pavement facial, it's because he's earned it. MEGHAN: Hey, wait! You're my hero. No, no, no, no. That I ain't! WADE: Nope. Never will be. Oh. Fuck you, Wade. I'm just a bad guy who gets paid to fuck up worse guys. Welcome to Sister Margaret's. It's like a job fair for mercenaries.

WOMAN: Come on, let's go. WOMAN: Oh, that must hurt. Thank you so much.  God, he's so fucking gnarly. WOMAN: Look at his face. MAN: Oh, my God. Poor guy. FEMALE PEDESTRIAN: Honey, don't stare. MALE PEDESTRIAN: Freak.   No way. I'm not making her life as ugly as mine. Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad. Ah, bullshit! I'm a monster inside and out. I belong in a fucking circus. Wade, Vanessa loves you. She doesn't care what you... Oh! Oh. Do you like what you see? No. You look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado. Yeah. Not gently. Like it was hate-fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship... and that was the only catharsis that they could find without violence. And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug... is the British shitstick who ran the mutant factory. And he's gone. Poof! Yeah, well you gotta do something to remedy this... because as of now, you only have one course of action. Damn straight. - Find Francis. - Star in horror films. What? Star in your own horror films. Because you look like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah. Here's what I'm actually gonna do. I'm gonna work through his crew until somebody gives up Francis... force him to fix this, then put a bullet in his skull..."
