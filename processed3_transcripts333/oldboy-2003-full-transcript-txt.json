        "Mister! It's a woman human being. That crazy guy took my sunglasses. Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone. My home is gone. I can't call my friends or relatives, because I'm someone who's murdered his wife. Because I'm a fugitive. I swear, man. Nah, he'll kick your ass. Come on, trust me, man. You fucktard! Fucktard. Never heard that one before. TV doesn't teach you curse words. 10 years of imaginary training. Is it any use in real life? It is. Striped beakfish. Oplegnathus fasciatus. Lives in the warm waters of coastal reefs. Despite its weak reflexes it's known to resist tenaciously when caught. In South Kyoung-sang Province its offspring... What's this smell? Don't even think about asking me any questions. I don't know a thing. Pardon? I said I want to eat something alive. Oh, right. Long time no see. This is my first time. Maybe not? But she looks familiar. You look very familiar. Where have we met? \"The Search for the Best Chefs\" Channel 11 Thursdays of 6:30. The youngest female Japanese cuisine chef in Korea. Oh that? They said the ratings are low but I guess not. Women's hands are warm so they can't make sushi. You sure do know a lot. Who are you? Do you like your clothes? Why... - Why did you lock me up? - Who do you think I am? - Loo Heung-sam! - Wrong. - Did Lee So-young hire you? - No, wrong again. Lee Jung-vow? Kong Chang-sum, Hwang Joo-yeon? Kim Na-sung? Park Jin-woo? Im Duk-yoon? Lee Jae-pyung? Kuk Su-ran? Who is it? Who the hell are you? Me? I'm sort of a scholar and my major is you. An Oh-Due-su-ologist. An expert on Oh Dae-su. Who I am isn't important. The important thing is why. Think it over. Review your whole life. School is over, so now it's time for homework. Right? Keep this in mind... Be it a grain of sand or a rock in water they sink the same. Let me ask you one thing. You hypnotized me in there didn't you? What was the hypnotic suggestion? I miss you. Hurry and come to me. Here you are. It's alive, right? May I slice it now? I must be different from other women. My hands are very cold. What's with her? Sir. Hold on. Hey mister, wake up... Keep this in mind. Be it a grain of sand or a rock in water they sink the same. You're awake? Is this true? That fever medicine really works. You fainted so easy for someone who exercised so much."

Is that a letdown? But it's true you simply forgot. Why? Because it wasn't your business. Your rumor grew to the point where they were saying Soo-ah got pregnant. My sister got sucked into that rumor and in the end, began to believe it. Then, her period actually stopped and her belly began to swell. Amazing, isn't it? Ever thought about the girl, pregnant with a child who's also her nephew? Understand now? Your tongue got my sister pregnant. It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick. It was Oh Dae-su's tongue. Is that why you killed your sister? I thought about the boy, about to father a child who's also his nephew. You were probably afraid. Afraid that everyone will find out once the baby's born.

What about this date, July 5th? This is no fun. I'll just finish what I was telling you. Listen carefully. My story is really fun. Ever heard of post-hypnotic suggestion? You suggest something during hypnosis and then it's acted out in your awakened state. Still haven't figured if out? You bring a complete stranger home who are you? Who are you, you rotten bastard? We hypnotized you both. One very fortunate thing was that you both were highly receptive to hypnosis compared to average people. Isn't this fun? One word gets you pregnant, one word gets you in love. But no matter how much you two are receptive to hypnosis or no matter how good a hypnotist Ms. Yoo is, getting people to fall in love isn't easy. So do you know what we did? - Oh that? - Your first suggestion, of course, was to go to that restaurant as soon as you were released. Next, to react to the specific melody from the cell phone. When you hear the melody you were to say certain words. Who are you? Do you like your clothes? To the man who says those words Mi-do was to perform a certain action.",
