      "raw_text": "There are many places we could begin the next chapter of the legend of Ron Burgundy. This is one such place. However, we won't begin our tale here. No, our story begins in a place all newsmen dream of. In New York City. Ron Burgundy! That lady's got an ass like the Loch Ness Monster. Thing is mysterious and ever sought after. Ron, aren't you going to say something to him? Hey, when you've got an ass like the North Star, wise men are going to want to follow it. It was a time before cell phones and steroids. And for Ron and his now-wife Veronica, life was good. The Tooth Fairy's exposed breast made the child uncomfortable. The bishop wore buttless chaps to the bat mitzvah. Bat mitzvah. The garden gnome had a normal-size penis. Corningstone. Corningstone. Oh, no! Oh, no! They're coming in through the back door! Oh, no! Oh, no! Grab the children! Save the children! Five, four... - Have a great broadcast. - You, too, darling. Good evening. This is the weekend edition of WBC News at 6:30. I'm Ron Burgundy. And I'm Veronica Corningstone. Our top story tonight. The U.N. today announced sanctions against... When the broadcast is over, send these two up to my office. Time to make a change. Rumor has it that after 35 years of manning the helm, Mack Tannen is thinking about stepping down. That's right. Do you think we could be getting the Nightly News, Ron? I think that's exactly what's about to happen. Oh, my God. That's what's happening, isn't it? - I'm hyperventilating. - Yes, I see that. Look at me. You... Well. I'm laughing like a ventriloquist's dummy. You are. Let's stop that before we get in there. Don't do that in there, darling. Mr. Tannen, you are an inspiration, sir. I've been doing the evening news now for over 35 years. - Done a hell of a job. - Yes, sir. A hell of a job! I've gone through four wives. I have six or seven kids that I haven't got the time to tell I love them. To be honest, they sound a little needy. And I killed four men in Okinawa. W.W. TWO. And that was two weeks ago. The point is, this is a very demanding job. Yes. But I'm close to thinking that you may have what it takes. Now, let me look at you. Oh, my God. Would it be wrong to say you smell terrific? - Ron, please! - Okay. What are you? Finnish? Oddly enough, I'm 100% full-blown Mexican.",

Right on the lens! Folks, I'm sorry. I hold myself to a high professional standard and you shouldn't hear that language, okay? I'm having a shitty day. Fuck-stick! Now, I know this is tricky, given your relationship, so I'm going to give you the evening to think about it. I forbid it! You forbid it? What? Who are you? Julius Caesar? Who the hell is Julius Caesar? You know I don't follow the NBA. Look, I am so sorry that this happened, Ron, but you and I, we're partners, sweetheart. And when something good happens to me, it also happens to you. That's ridiculous! It clearly just happened to you! You... Be quiet. Mom? I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Burgundy. He no go to sleep. Damn it, Lupita, what have you been doing up there? Eating nachos? Mommy? Daddy? Why are you yelling at each other? Did Mom touch Dad's hair again? Walter, honey, why don't you just go to bed, all right? Mommy and Daddy are just having a discussion. No! He needs to hear this. He's six years old. He's a man. Walter, listen to me. Life isn't a fairy tale. It's not a bunch of jumping rope and grabbing ass. It's complicated. What do you want to do with your life? What do you want to be when you grow up?

So, let's say hello to the stars of the show, Chippy and Roo-roo! For your information, Chippy was rehabilitated and Roo-roo is an asshole. Look, they're swimming and doing tricks! Folks, what do you expect? They're dolphins. What did you say? Look at you, with that permanent smile. You think you're so smart, with your secret language. You just fart out of the top of your head. You're a punk, Ron Burgundy! Children and animals hate you, Ron Burgundy! I would eat dolphins if it was legal! Unhand me, you buffoons! All right, first, you threw up in the shark tank. Then you fed the seals a chicken gyro? And now this? You're fired, you washed-up drunk! Guess what, Trevor? Every morning I get here a half hour early and I sexually assault a starfish! This is the end of the road. I'm not turning back. Well, I know it's not a pretty sight. And you're gonna be the sole witness. If you can't handle it, you leave the room. It's too late, Baxter.

And I saw no other option? I think you're telling the truth, but why are you saying it like you're lying? It was a call for help? But it didn't work because I'm too heavy and the ceiling lamp broke? Something like that? Yeah, I think you're telling the truth. I am. That's what happened. These are first-rate flapjacks. I'm telling you, suicide makes you hungry, I don't care what anyone says. My name is Freddie Shapp, and I'm a producer of a new kind of news. We're starting a 24-hour news channel. First of its kind! GNN. The Global News Network. That is without a doubt the dumbest thing I've ever heard. You mean news going 24 hours around the clock? A channel that's never off, in other words? Yeah. Yeah. Just 24 hours. It's... No offense, but you are a stupid asshole. Mr. Burgundy, I assure you we are 100% for real. We've got state-of-the-art facilities in Manhattan. And Kench Allenby, multi-millionaire and owner of Koala Airlines. So glad he was acquitted of murder. I'm a big Kench Allenby guy. He's funding the whole network. He believes in it. I don't think you understand, Freddie. My hero, Mack Tannen, told me I was the worst journalist he'd ever seen. I'm not good enough. Here. This is your first week's salary. By the hymen of Olivia Newton-John! What do you say, Ron? I'll take the job. And I swear I'll be number one again. I'll take back my son, restore my reputation, and make everything right with Veronica. But more importantly, I'm going to do what God put Ron Burgundy on this Earth to do. Have salon-quality hair and read the news. Ron... You've made my day. I've got the best damn news team in the world. - Your call. - I just have to find them. San Diago. Looks like we begin our search right here at home. Last I heard, Champ Kind was fired for being drunk on the air and saying, \"The only Olympic sport Filipinos are good at is eating cats and dogs.\" - Who loves chicken? You do! - We do! Delicious chicken Swing on through Meet the crew! I'm local San Diego legend Champ Kind, and I believe in two things. Good chicken, and that the census is a way for the U.N.",

Something like that? Yeah, I think you're telling the truth. I am. That's what happened. These are first-rate flapjacks. I'm telling you, suicide makes you hungry, I don't care what anyone says. My name is Freddie Shapp, and I'm a producer of a new kind of news. We're starting a 24-hour news channel. First of its kind! GNN. The Global News Network. That is without a doubt the dumbest thing I've ever heard. You mean news going 24 hours around the clock? A channel that's never off, in other words? Yeah. Yeah. Just 24 hours. It's... No offense, but you are a stupid asshole. Mr. Burgundy, I assure you we are 100% for real. We've got state-of-the-art facilities in Manhattan. And Kench Allenby, multi-millionaire and owner of Koala Airlines. So glad he was acquitted of murder. I'm a big Kench Allenby guy. He's funding the whole network. He believes in it. I don't think you understand, Freddie. My hero, Mack Tannen, told me I was the worst journalist he'd ever seen. I'm not good enough. Here. This is your first week's salary. By the hymen of Olivia Newton-John! What do you say, Ron? I'll take the job. And I swear I'll be number one again. I'll take back my son, restore my reputation, and make everything right with Veronica. But more importantly, I'm going to do what God put Ron Burgundy on this Earth to do. Have salon-quality hair and read the news. Ron... You've made my day. I've got the best damn news team in the world. - Your call. - I just have to find them. San Diago. Looks like we begin our search right here at home. Last I heard, Champ Kind was fired for being drunk on the air and saying, \"The only Olympic sport Filipinos are good at is eating cats and dogs.\" - Who loves chicken? You do! - We do! Delicious chicken Swing on through Meet the crew! I'm local San Diego legend Champ Kind, and I believe in two things. Good chicken, and that the census is a way for the U.N."

You are the dumbest person I've met in my entire life, and that's not an exaggeration. That makes me feel bad. Well, it's the truth, Chani. You! - Leave her alone! - Excuse me, sir. Get your filthy hands off of her! Help. Help! Excuse me, sir! - Leave me alone, lady! - Excuse me! She is a goddess among women! Glen! MY phone messages! Leave him alone! Not today! - She has butterflies in her heart! - Chani! I can see you behind that desk, and you're fired! Why? Are you okay? You saved my life. She was trying to set me on fire. I didn't ask for these powers. I was given them. Last night a bird chased me, and I wished it was you. Can we go to a date? Yes. Dear God, please help me pull this off. I swear, if you help me, I will become a monk. I will shave my head and become a monk... Who are we kidding? I'm not going to do that. Did you hear?

And serious investigative pieces, about how much ejaculate is on hotel duvets. And only the best sports highlights. Home runs, slam dunks, touchdowns and no soccer. I like the Wind! Brick's right. People love hurricanes. Tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, we'll throw Brick right in the middle of it. You'd do that? People'll go nuts. I'd watch that! No, this goes against every rule of broadcast journalism I know. Freddie, as the wise man once said, \"So?\" We got 10 hours till we go on. We'll only need eight! Lady I'm your knight in shining armor And I love you You have made me what I am And I am yours My love... - Is that candy? - I don't know. It is candy. - I like you. - I like you. Tell me something about you. Well, I'm 19 years old. My middle name is Courtney. I can always guess how many jelly beans are in a jelly bean jar, even if it's not right. What about you? My name is Chani Lastnamé. I'm a real go-getter and a person people. I can type 50 words a minute with only 300 errors. I'm trained and certified... To fire a military-grade missile launcher. Me, too. Chani, I just got these phone messages from last week. You mailed them to me? How else was I gonna get them to you? You hand them to me.

She's the greatest country in the world. Heck, the history of the world! You're damn right! Too much of the news is about what's wrong with America. Amen, brother! Well, tonight, our top story is what's right with America. Someone's finally talking sense on the TV. For starters, we kick butt. Nazi butt. Russian butt. What the hell is he doing? He's talking about America. Why, do you have a problem with that? Tonight I begin part one of my 11-part series on the power and mystery of the human vagina. This series will be a tasteful look at just what makes a vagina tick, as well as a look at the 50 greatest vaginae of the 20th century. Son of a bitch! One final question, and I'll let you go. Who tops the list of the top 50 greatest vaginae? Well, I don't want to give anything away. I thought I had you. I will give you number two. - Please. - Madame Curie. Of course. Of course. Whammy!

Okay, but you're answering the question, so I think you can hear me. No, I can! Brick, do you think there is any danger to the average person out there? I'm afraid for the animals of New York, Ron. I saw a woman, and her dog never touched the ground. You're saying wind gusts as fast as a supersonic jet? It looked like she was walking a dog balloon. And go... Switch. And for our eighth and final animal story of the night, it looks like residents of North Yulk, Montana, have found the cutest little patriot on God's green earth. Look at that little guy! He was having some fun. Well, for all of us here at GNN, I'm Ron Burgundy. And don't just have a great night, have an American night. And we're out! - I couldn't take my eyes off the screen! - Yes.

Excuse me? - That's my mama, man. - Hey. Wave your hands in the air. Wave your hands in the air like you just don't care. Please, don't do this. Now, which one of you pipe-hittin' bitches can pass me the mashed potatoes? I don't think that dinner could've gone any better. Are you nuts? No, I'm not! I had a wonderful evening! My dad was kicking you in the head! I thought it was like being jumped into a gang. Only with dinner guests! You called my family \"pipe-hittin' bitches\"!

You really want to know the one thing you should be afraid of? Yes, I really do. Voodoo. - Voodoo? - Yes, voodoo. That shit will mess you up. And it is 100% real. Promise me that you'll never go to Haiti. I promise, Dad. This was good. I enjoyed spending time with you. Me, too, Dad. And hey. Do you want to go to Haiti sometime? - No. - Good. Good. What did you tell him? I didn't tell him anything. He hasn't slept for four days, Ron! Everywhere we go, he asks me if we're going to Haiti! What does that even mean? I am so sick and tired that you've sheltered him from the evils of voodoo. You need to learn to connect with him in a healthy way! Let me ask you something, and I'm not trying to be funny here.

Keep up the graphics. Reaching speeds of 100 miles per hour. And for the first time in news history, we will stay with it live until it resolves in either a huge accident or a massive shootout.

Keep up the graphics. Reaching speeds of 100 miles per hour. And for the first time in news history, we will stay with it live until it resolves in either a huge accident or a massive shootout.

You have to use your other senses now! I can't do it! Baxter found something on the beach!"

No, he just swam away, and he's instantly looking for fish to eat. He was my best friend.

I bottle-fed and raised a shark. And I smoked a fair amount of crack. But the most important thing I've learned is that there was an emptiness left after turning my back on three of the best friends anyone could ever ask for. Hi, Ron! So, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to see my child's recital and tell the woman I love that I still love her. Good night, America, and never forget, you deserve the truth. Good. He's dead, done. Linda, get the skirt in, the blonde. Anyone! He's coming back! Also, one other thing. Koala Airlines is a really shitty airline. You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Guys, I'm sorry. For a while there, I don't know what became of Ron Burgundy. Brick, I'm sorry I yelled at you. Brian, I... No reason why I killed that story of yours. It was excellent reporting. And, Champ, I'm sorry I said no to all those offers for late-night deep-tissue rubdowns. Ron, you're a good man. But you have fallen victim to your own ego and your own hubris. And before others can forgive you, you must learn to forgive yourself. What was that, Brick? I'm wearing two pairs of pants. Thank you. So that's it? You're sorry? You know what, Burgundy? Apologies are like assholes. Everyone's got one and everyone's got a shoebox full of Polaroids of them under the bed. Ron, we're a team. We need you. Let him go, Champ. Ron! Long live Ron Burgundy! I'm Brick Tamland for GNN News. The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout. You little hack! Who the hell do you think you are? After everything I've done for you, this is how you repay me? Well, I will crush you! Once again, Mr. Burgundy, you are the ballsiest white man I've ever known. What the hell? One more for old times' sake. Thank you. Is Dad going to come? No, sweetheart, Daddy has to work. He's going to come. I know it. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Damn it! It's so hard for a proud Mexican to get a taxi in this city! I need to see my son! And now, to play an original composition that he wrote for his father, here is seven-year-old Walter Burgundy. I made a promise! I made a promise to my son! What the hell? Well, hello, Ron.

Wes Mantooth and the Channel Nine news team! Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here? This is a national news fight. You made one mistake today. You messed with somebody from San Diego. It's actually pronounced San Diago. Hell, Ron and I may not agree on everything, but we share the bond of being from the greatest city in the history of this Earth. Well, ain't that cute? But you're outnumbered three-to-one. Why don't you go back to your mama? Don't you use my mom's name in vain. Dorothy Mantooth was a hard-working single woman who raised seven children on her own, and she remained sexually active till the day she died. She brought pole dancing into the mainstream. Now here's the thing. While I've been talking, my news team has emptied their gas tanks at your feet. I drop this smoke and every one of you goes \"poof.\" Well, you forgot one thing, leatherman. You drop that smoke, you die, too. With the things I've done in my life, I know I'm going to burn in hell. So I sure as shit ain't afraid to burn here on Earth. Oh, my goodness! That's the most badass thing I have ever heard. All right! Looks like this fight's over. Let's go, boys. Yay! We won! Let's celebrate! Sparklers! - No, no, no, Brick! - No! - Bravo! Bravo. - Yeah. Dad! Son, I fought a Minotaur to be here. And I'd do it again. Dad! Together we can defeat voodoo! Ron had finally learned how to love his son and his wife more than his career. And as it turned out, his walking off the news was the highest-rated TV event of the year. He and his news team, along with Veronica, could have any job they wanted. But before that, they had one little thing to take care of. And now, before I join this couple in holy matrimony, Brick and Chani ask us to join them as they exchange their vows. My dearest Brick. Everything I have is yours. My four lawnmowers. My sister. My 35 ferrets. My massive student loan and real estate debt. It's all yours. Chani. I will never forget the exact moment I saw you. My pee-pee got all uncomfortable in my pants, and I thought, \"Here comes the warm milkshake out of the tip of my belly stick.\" Wait!",

        "No! That is out of the question! We're outnumbered, Ron. Foam the runway, I'm coming in hot! Old MacDonald had a farm And then four guys on bikes showed up. Wes Mantooth and the Channel Nine news team! Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here? This is a national news fight. You made one mistake today. You messed with somebody from San Diego. It's actually pronounced San Diago. Hell, Ron and I may not agree on everything, but we share the bond of being from the greatest city in the history of this Earth. Well, ain't that cute? But you're outnumbered three-to-one. Why don't you go back to your mama? Don't you use my mom's name in vain. Dorothy Mantooth was a hard-working single woman who raised seven children on her own, and she remained sexually active till the day she died. She brought pole dancing into the mainstream. Now here's the thing. While I've been talking, my news team has emptied their gas tanks at your feet. I drop this smoke and every one of you goes \"poof.\" Well, you forgot one thing, leatherman. You drop that smoke, you die, too. With the things I've done in my life, I know I'm going to burn in hell. So I sure as shit ain't afraid to burn here on Earth. Oh, my goodness! That's the most badass thing I have ever heard. All right! Looks like this fight's over. Let's go, boys. Yay! We won! Let's celebrate! Sparklers! - No, no, no, Brick! - No! - Bravo! Bravo. - Yeah.
