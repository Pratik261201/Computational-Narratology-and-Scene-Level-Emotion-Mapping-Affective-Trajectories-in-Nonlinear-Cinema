Once I sat on a toilet seat at a truck stop and caught haemorrhoids, and I've learned to live with this chicken bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years. So I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction. Dad, I don't want to upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing, cancer. I'm dying. Okay. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge. All right. Who's in? Raise your hand. Are you coming or not, Thomas J.? I don't think so. I knew he wouldn't come. I can't. I have to go home. Yeah, to play with his dolls. Leave him alone. Come on, let's go. Hey! You didn't pay me. How do I know you're gonna show us one? You're such a baby. All right. Here. Okay, follow me and don't say a word. You ready? You sure you want to see it? Or is someone going to go yellow-belly? I'm not chicken! Okay. Lean forward. It's empty- You're so weird. I want my money back. - I was afraid of this. - Of what? Well, sometimes when we get them, they're not completely dead. You know, like when they cut a chicken's head off and they still run around crazy. You're full of shit. I bet she's roaming around this house somewhere. There she is. In the rocking chair. Let's get out of here. Quick. Come on. Hurry UP- Hi, Gramoo. Vada, would you bring down my cigarettes? See you later. Did I tell you he was my woodshop teacher? You took woodshop? Yeah, I made a tie rack. I made a tie rack. - Was it fancy? - Yeah. Vada, just put them on the stool. Daddy, guess what? I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly yesterday. Yeah. Rack holds six ties. I still have mine. Arthur! Vada! I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly yesterday. Good for you, baby. Once you put the hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place, you're a shoo-in to win. I like to buy up all the railroads. Vada, we're trying to work here. Cruella De Vil stole all the puppies. She was going to make a fur out of them. Hand me the cannula. Vada. Dad? I'm embalming my high school teacher. Don't sing. All right, Arthur. Just slide him to me a little bit. That's it. That's good. Okay. Put him in a nice model c-501. Bronze, stainless Eternal Journey. Yeah, he'll look like a champion. Is Mr Harry Sultenfuss in? Sure. Come on in.",

Prostate cancer. Once it hits your prostate, you're a goner. How may I help you? I'm Shelly DeVoto. We spoke the other day regarding the makeup artist job? Yes. It's still available, I hope? I think it's still available. I'm a licensed cosmetologist. I worked for two years at the Dino Raphael salon. All my customers cried when I told them I was leaving. - Miss DeVoto... - I have a wonderful disposition. I put people right at ease. Miss DeVoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a beauty parlour. It's a funeral parlour. They're dead? Yes, they are. Stiffs? Deceased. The ad just said makeup artist. Excuse me a second, will you? Sure. Hi, George. This is a 1258. I didn't want the burnished handles. - Is that your camper? - Yes, it is. That's really cool. Hello. She's shy. Just put it back in the display room, fellas. Okay, Harry. Daddy, how come that coffin's so small? They come in all sizes, honey, just like shoes. Is it for a Child? Of course not. Then who's it for? Short people. Very short people. Excuse me. What about the job? Pardon? I need the job. You still want it, even though... Sure, it's no big deal. You see, all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive. So they have something in common. You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone. Okay, Mr Sultenfuss. - You've got a deal. - Great. - You can start right away. - Okay. Call me Harry. Now... ls this what you'd normally wear for work or... - Look... - Don't get me wrong. I like it very much, but the... I promise I'll take good care of these people. They deserve it. They're dead. All they've got left is their looks. Hey, look at this. No feet. Wow, a real Evel Knievel. What the hell are you doing in my garage? Get out of here! Hi, Vada, what's wrong today? I'm very sick. Okay, take a seat. I'll check if the doctor can see you. Vada's here. She says she's very sick. She looks all right to me. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He'll see you. Why don't you go in? Well, what is it? I can handle it. You are perfectly healthy. That can't be. I have all the classic symptoms. Sweetheart, did they bring Mr Layton to your house today?",

Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr J. - How's the summer treating you? - It's okay. Mr Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading. Really? Already? The summer's just begun. Yes, and now I'm reading War and Peace for fun. No wonder you're my prize pupil. - What about you, Thomas J.? - I haven't started yet. Better get on his case, Vada. Mr Bixler, how come you're painting this old house? Well, I just bought it. Now I'm fixing it up. This is one big house for one single person. Well, you never can tell. I might get a pet. How are you going to get the money to pay for this old house if you're not working? Well, I'm going to teach creative writing this summer. So, I'm doing some work. - How much does it cost? - $35. What do you get for that? Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. - This an interrogation, Vada? - No. Well, I guess I'll go home and finish off War and Peace. It's summer. You're kids. Go play. Want to go to Gray's orchard and pick some peaches? - No, I'm going home. - Why? It's not dinnertime yet. \"Dinnertime\"? You're like a dog. You just go home to eat! Don't pee on the hydrant! Rupert Gwynn called. There was a big accident on PA-34. They're bringing in two tomorrow. Excuse me, Harry, I finished Mr Layton's hair. He kinda looked... Harry, what's wrong with her? She's just pretending. Vada, get up here and eat your broccoli. I think it's my prostate. No. How many removals did you say we were expecting? Two. I'm gonna have to do a v-section on one. Can you give me a hand? Well, I guess so. If you want. Now this isn't gonna be a repeat of that smelter accident a few years ago, is it? Don't mock that. That's how we bought the new Cadillac. Yes, I know that. Except, I had a body in my bedroom, you had a body in your bedroom. We were littered with peoples' bodies. - Who's winning? - I am. Look. Vada and her little boyfriend.

Judy's father owns the Bijou Theater, and we get to see all the movies for free. - Maybe you can come sometime. - Don't invite her. She'll have to bring her boyfriend. You know, Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you. I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating. Want a piece of chocolate? - Thomas J.? - I'm allergic to it. - To chocolate? - He's allergic to everything. To chocolate? - To everything. - To everything. - That's a pretty ring you're wearing. - It's a mood ring. It tells what mood I'm in. It doesn't work. It always stays black. It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood. Maybe black means you're happy. I don't think so. Shelly, how can I get $35? She's crazy. She wants to go to school over the summer. It's not a real school. It's a writing class. I want to be a writer. She only wants to go because her sweetie pie's the teacher. Shut your big fat mouth! I think you'd make a fine writer. Did you ask your dad? He won't give it to me. Well, you don't know that. Ask him. Edith, what channel is Cronkite on? Channel 2, Archie, the one we don't watch 'cause you always say Walter Cronkite is a communist. I never said that, Edith. The man ain't all red. What's the matter with this? There ain't nothing coming on. I'll help you fix it, Daddy. Daddy, can I have $35? That's a lot of money for a little girl. It's for school. A summer writing class. Any more soda left? Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer. Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist. Dad? I love this guy. - Dad? - What? The money? Well, maybe next summer. He forgot about the time I wanted to be a magician. I was really great at making myself disappear. - Want to play? - No. I got to go to the cemetery. Keep your head up. Don't look at the ball. Look at me. See? You were looking at the ball. All right? Keep your head up. Give me some skin. All right. Please! Open the door! Please, someone, open the door! Please! Please! Open the door! Vada? Vada? What happened? My ball. I lost my ball. Come on, sweetie. Excuse me, Harry? - Could you take a look at Mrs Porter? - Yeah. Didn't I give you a picture of what she looked like?",

        "Do you think I'd kiss that ugly old thing? Yeah, anyway. Come on, let's go. Judy's father owns the Bijou Theater, and we get to see all the movies for free. - Maybe you can come sometime. - Don't invite her. She'll have to bring her boyfriend. You know, Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you. I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating. Want a piece of chocolate? - Thomas J.? - I'm allergic to it. - To chocolate? - He's allergic to everything. To chocolate? - To everything. - To everything. - That's a pretty ring you're wearing. - It's a mood ring. It tells what mood I'm in. It doesn't work. It always stays black. It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood. Maybe black means you're happy. I don't think so. Shelly, how can I get $35? She's crazy. She wants to go to school over the summer. It's not a real school. It's a writing class. I want to be a writer. She only wants to go because her sweetie pie's the teacher. Shut your big fat mouth! I think you'd make a fine writer. Did you ask your dad? He won't give it to me. Well, you don't know that. Ask him. Edith, what channel is Cronkite on? Channel 2, Archie, the one we don't watch 'cause you always say Walter Cronkite is a communist. I never said that, Edith. The man ain't all red. What's the matter with this? There ain't nothing coming on. I'll help you fix it, Daddy. Daddy, can I have $35? That's a lot of money for a little girl. It's for school. A summer writing class. Any more soda left?

A girl's always got to look her best. I think lipstick looks fake. No one's lips are that colour. - Have you ever tried any? - No. Come here. Sit down. Go like this. A little less. Okay. All right. Now, first, we blot. Take a look. I think it looks real nice on you. Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?"

That's great. - I'm very nervous. - Why? - The last date I had was 20 years ago. - That's true. Harry. Harry. Sit down. Let me fill you in on today's women.

Good night. Before the class started, Ronda and Justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation. That's really cool. Okay, what we're going to do is send our vibes out into the group. Everybody hold hands and close your eyes. Relax your muscles and take deep breaths. Now, try to feel what the other person is feeling without speaking any words. Send out your vibe and receive the vibes around you at the same time. Can you feel it? Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody feel? I felt Mrs Hunsaker's strength. I can feel that Ronda is one with the earth. She's so cosmically in tune. So right on. That's exactly what I sent out, and I felt like you were full of inner peace and harmony. Vada, what did you feel? I felt Justin's hangnail. No, Vada. That's not what we're looking for. A hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul? Feel my aura. I don't think I'm allowed to. Tell you what. Let's try it again. Hold hands. Gramoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. It got infected and travelled to her vocal cords. Ruined her singing voice. I don't think Gramoo thought it was insignificant. And some lettuce. Watch out for the rust when you get lettuce. Hey! I thought I recognised you two. - Hi, Vada. - Hi. - We were picking things up for the barbecue. - Yeah, me, too. Mind if I tag along? Not at all. - A lot of potatoes. - It's for Shelly's famous potato salad. I'm looking forward to that. Hey! Damn it! - Vada, watch what you're doing. - Sorry. You know, this is gonna be my first Fourth of July picnic. Really? Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes real bad? Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all. I don't know what's gotten into her today. I need olives. I used to like my Ken and Barbie dolls. Ken was my favourite. Then one Christmas, I got them a camper and all they wanted to do was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a cliff. Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry. I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. - You've cremated them. - That's what I do. - You want to do it?",

I would never marry anybody I didn't love. He must like Shelly. I never saw him hit anyone in his life. He likes her. Does he love her? Probably. Do you like her? Yes, I do. - And I think she's very good for your father. - Why? After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny. Really?

I don't think that the roller coaster agreed with your dad's stomach. You know, Vada, you have to watch what you eat here. I remember once I went to a carnival with my cousins, David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs and the next day they came down with nephritis. Nephritis is a kidney disease. - You don't get it from hot dogs. - Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science. They were in a magazine. They were! Popular Mechanics... No, Popular Science. I don't know. It was Popular. - Look, they're trying to hit that poor thing. - Watch you don't knock out a fish. Just arc it. I don't know which ball's mine. - I won! I won! - Great! We have a winner. There you go, little girl. See how easy it is, folks. Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish. Where did you get that ring? Did you win it? Vada, we have something to tell you. Harry? Vada, we have some good news. Shelly and I are getting married. My fish! We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer. You'll be okay, little fish. Vada, would you like us to get you another goldfish? No. He's fine. Fish are very resilient animals, you know. Don't worry. I won't get another fish. The bumper car! The bumper car! For just 50 cents, a half dollar, five dimes, ten nickels, we have a ride that's guaranteed to rearrange all of your internal organs. Don't pass me by! That's the bumper car ride! Bumper cars! You can't go to a carnival and not ride the bumper cars. I'd fall asleep at the wheel. - I'll ride on the bumper cars with you. - Great, Vada, come on. Two. I got the blue one! - No. - Yes. I'm going to come get you. Vada, keep your hands on the wheel. Careful, Vada. Careful. Shelly, look out! - Hi, Vada. - Hi, can Thomas J. come out? Sure, come on in.",

Will you tell her I came by? - Sure. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi, Harry. - Hi, Reverend Moss. The Sennett's want to thank you for taking care of things so quickly. Vada? I see you took your tray in. Maybe you should come down for the funeral. Sometimes it helps. Vada? She won't come out. It's been a whole day. You have to do something, Harry. The funeral's starting. Open your eyes. She's 11 years old. Her only friend in the world is dead. I know that, but what do you want from me? Stop hiding, Harry. You run, Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people didn't exactly thrill me. But when I saw a family lived here, I thought, \"If I'm living without a family, \"at least I can work with one. \"And maybe once in a while be invited in for supper.\" Yeah. And when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive. I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn’t just death, Harry. Don't ignore the living. Especially your daughter. Excuse me, Harry, Shelly, the minister's about to begin. Thank you, Arthur. We are here to honour Thomas James Sennett. He was born May 7, 1961 in Madison, Pennsylvania. He is survived by his loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett, his grandparents, William and Gloria Sennett, and Gerald and Marjorie Finn, and many relatives, friends and schoolmates. The interment will follow at Madison Memorial Park. The family has asked me to say a few words before we proceed to the cemetery. No words I could say would begin to express the loss and grief we feel. One word that keeps ringing in my ear is \"why?\" Why would God choose to take this little boy from us? Well, I can't give you an answer to that question, but I can tell you that God has chosen Thomas J. For some very special reason. We must find solace in knowing that Thomas J. is in God's care. In that place, there is no sorrow or suffering. The lion lies with the lamb. The day is not divided. I'd like to read a passage from the Bible. This is Matthew 19113. \"At one point, children were brought to him \"that he might lay his hands on them and pray. \"The disciples began to chastise them.",

        "I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J. Well, maybe she'll feel better in a couple days. Will you tell her I came by? - Sure. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi, Harry. - Hi, Reverend Moss. The Sennett's want to thank you for taking care of things so quickly. Vada? I see you took your tray in. Maybe you should come down for the funeral. Sometimes it helps. Vada? She won't come out. It's been a whole day. You have to do something, Harry. The funeral's starting. Open your eyes. She's 11 years old. Her only friend in the world is dead. I know that, but what do you want from me? Stop hiding, Harry. You run, Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people didn't exactly thrill me. But when I saw a family lived here, I thought, \"If I'm living without a family, \"at least I can work with one. \"And maybe once in a while be invited in for supper.\" Yeah. And when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive. I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn’t just death, Harry. Don't ignore the living. Especially your daughter. Excuse me, Harry, Shelly, the minister's about to begin. Thank you, Arthur. We are here to honour Thomas James Sennett. He was born May 7, 1961 in Madison, Pennsylvania. He is survived by his loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett, his grandparents, William and Gloria Sennett, and Gerald and Marjorie Finn, and many relatives, friends and schoolmates. The interment will follow at Madison Memorial Park. The family has asked me to say a few words before we proceed to the cemetery. No words I could say would begin to express the loss and grief we feel. One word that keeps ringing in my ear is \"why?\" Why would God choose to take this little boy from us? Well, I can't give you an answer to that question, but I can tell you that God has chosen Thomas J. For some very special reason. We must find solace in knowing that Thomas J. is in God's care. In that place, there is no sorrow or suffering. The lion lies with the lamb. The day is not divided. I'd like to read a passage from the Bible.
