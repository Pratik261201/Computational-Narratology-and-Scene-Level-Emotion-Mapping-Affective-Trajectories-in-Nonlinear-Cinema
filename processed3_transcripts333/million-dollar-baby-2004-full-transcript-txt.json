      "raw_text": "You got him! You got him! Only ever met one man I wouldn't want to fight. I can't stop that. Here. Get out of here, you useless tit. When I met him, he was already the best cut man in the business. Can you stop it? Started training and managing in the '60s, but he never lost his gift. No. Let me have a look at him. He's fine. He's fine. Well, he ain't if you don't stop this bleeding. I'll give you one more round. Seconds out. Let's go. What do we do? Tell me what to do. You let him hit you. Sometimes there's just nothing you can do. Cut's too wide too close to the bone. Maybe you got a severed vein, or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough. There are all kinds of combinations you come up against down in the different layers of meat, and Frankie knew how to work every one. People love violence. They slow down at a car wreck to check for bodies. Same people claim to love boxing. They got no idea what it is. Boxing is about respect - getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. I'll warm up the car. Mr. Dunn? Hmm. I owe you money? No, sir. I know your mama? Don't rightly know, sir. Then what is it you want? I was on the undercard. I won my fight, too. Maggie Fitzgerald. Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up? Did you happen to see it? - Nope. - I did pretty good. Thought you might be interested in training me. I don't train girls. Maybe you should. People see me fight say I'm pretty tough. Girlie, tough ain't enough. It's a mistake. Car should be able to back up, Frankie. Just push, will you? What did Hogan want? Offered us a title shot. - 'Bout time. - I turned him down flat. Two or three more fights, you'll be ready. Been two or three more fights for a long time now, Frankie. Look, Willie, you get one shot at the title. You lose it, it may not come around again. Now, two or three more fights, and we'll be ready. Whatever you say, Frankie. Frankie liked to say that boxing is an unnatural act, that everything in boxing is backwards. Sometimes, best way to deliver a punch is step back. Well, do your best, Lord, to... protect Katy. Annie, too. Other than that... you know what I want. There's no use me repeating myself. But step back too far you ain't fightin' at all. Thank you for your prayers. - Bye. - Goodbye. Hey, Father, that was a great sermon.",

It's not going to happen this morning. Well, I'm confused. - No, you aren't. - Yes, I am. Then here's your answer: There's one God. Anything else?

There are no demigods, you fuckin' pagan! Did you write to your daughter? Absolutely. Now you're lying to a priest. You know what? Take a day off. Don't come to Mass tomorrow.

Yeah. Yeah. Lots of people where I comes from does, but my mama taught me not to cause hurt to no man, niggers or not. You got a nice mama. Anything else I can do for you? Just one of those questions, but Danger wanted to give it his best answer. Well, sir, I'd likes to become the Welterweight Champion of the world. And I challenge the Motor City Cobra, Thomas \"Hit Man\" Hearns, to fight me for the Welterweight Championship of the whole world! Yo, Flip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked. You got to have at least one fight to be ranked. Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime! Hey you a bad man huh? Hey, come on, get in the ring. Go a round with me. Shawrelle... I will. Leave him alone. Danger, you go on back to training. Will do, Mr. Scrap. Ow! Them some nice tights, Danger. I'll give you that ass-whoopin' later, Olive Oyl.",

Keep rotating, that keeps your head moving, and keep one shoulder back so you're always ready to fire a power shot. Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good. Keep rotating. Keep moving. That's it. Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in. Come on around. Keep moving, keep moving. Good, good, good, good. - Like that? - Yeah. Keep on moving, give it a few shots. Tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in. That's good. That's good. Now, you get this down, we'll put you on the speed bag. You do have a speed bag? I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own. All right, you go on home now. I'll walk out with you? No, I am home. Want to see? Yeah. It's nice. Would it bother you much if I worked a little longer? No, just... pull the door closed when you leave. Thank you. If there's magic in boxing, it's the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance, beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas. It's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you. OK, come on. Watch the footwork. Hey, Flip. Hey, Flippy, come here, man. I think I found somebody you can beat. I don't fights women. Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro, cos you know why? Cos she - nah, you- you could fight to him and then you could kiss to him, and then you could fight to him one more time.

What's he lookin' at? Looks like a bottle of water. He paid his dues? Dues? Boy can't afford pants. Want him to pay dues? Get out of my office. Fuck me. Can't think of it as a bag. I'm not a trainer, but I can show you this, if you'd like. Appreciate any help I can get. OK. Let's see. What you want to do is you want to think of it as a man, see? And he's constantly moving. He's moving towards you. He's moving around you. He's moving away from you, all right? You don't want to hit him when he's coming towards you cos what he's going to do is push you back. He's going to smother your punches, take your balance, right? So watch him carefully. Keep rotating, that keeps your head moving, and keep one shoulder back so you're always ready to fire a power shot. Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good. Keep rotating. Keep moving. That's it. Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in. Come on around. Keep moving, keep moving. Good, good, good, good. - Like that? - Yeah. Keep on moving, give it a few shots. Tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in. That's good. That's good. Now, you get this down, we'll put you on the speed bag. You do have a speed bag? I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own. All right, you go on home now. I'll walk out with you? No, I am home. Want to see? Yeah. It's nice. Would it bother you much if I worked a little longer? No, just... pull the door closed when you leave. Thank you. If there's magic in boxing, it's the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance, beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas. It's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you. OK, come on. Watch the footwork. Hey, Flip. Hey, Flippy, come here, man. I think I found somebody you can beat. I don't fights women. Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro, cos you know why? Cos she - nah, you- you could fight to him and then you could kiss to him, and then you could fight to him one more time. That's beautiful, man."

Other truth is, my brother's in prison, my sister cheats on welfare by pretending one of her babies is still alive, my daddy's dead, and my mama weighs 312 pounds. If I was thinking straight, I'd go back home, find a used trailer, buy a deep fryer and some Oreos. The problem is, this is the only thing I ever felt good doing. If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing. That enough truth to suit you? This your speed bag? Put yours behind the counter. Wish I could say I wore it out. OK. Just hold it, hold it.

I ain't doing great. I'm losing. You're wearing her down. Nice night, ain't it? Jesus Christ. That's Lonnie Washington's girl. Hell of a fighter. 11 and 0. Your left. Keep your left up. Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters. He's got Joey Adagio, lightweight champ. Yeah. Your left, damn it! Wouldn't have been my choice for a first fight, but Sally's a good manager. He must think she can take her. Jesus H, your left! Keep your left up! You think she can hear you from back here? Of course, if Maggie loses, it wouldn't mean anything to Sally. Might even help him. Lonnie's girl gets another win, Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight fight Joey Adagio for the title. Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio? Hey, what do I know? I just come cos I enjoy the fights. Mother of God! OK, break! Hey! Come here, come here. Hey get over here! You're dropping your left hand. Quit dropping your left hand. Hey, Frankie, you mind if I talk to my fighter? You're doing a hell of a job of it. Is this how you advise your lightweight? Dunn, what the hell are you doing? - I'm talking. What you doing? - This your fighter? It's my fighter! It ain't fitting real well, Sally. Fine. You take her. She can't fight worth a shit, anyway. Somebody tell me what's going on. I was late. Sally was just subbing for me. You're telling me this is your fighter? Yeah, this is my fighter. Then you got ten seconds. I keep holding my left up, then I throw a punch and it drops. - Well, let it drop. - That'd be a lot easier. She thinks she knows you, that's all. Every time you drop it, she comes right over the top, so you just wait for her, see? That's all she's thinking about. And when she cocks that big right hand, you hear me? And when she does, you step to the side and come over with this big \"good night\" hook. - Got one? - Got it right here. OK. - Fight, or I'm calling it. - Go give it to her. The body knows what fighters don't - how to protect itself.",

After her 12th straight knockout, Frankie got a couple of real good offers. The first was to fight Billie, \"The Blue Bear\", Osterman for the WBA welterweight title. Billie the Blue Bear! Billie was a former prostitute out of East Berlin. Had a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks. Didn't matter to her, something like that could kill a person. And the crowds loved her. He turned it down without even telling her. The next was to fight the British champ, a Jamaican girl Billie just beat. Hello? Not interested. He turned that down too. That's a lot of money, boss. Yeah. You're making money. What're you still working here for? It's a title match, right? Are you British? It's a title you can't take away. She's got nothing to lose, you got nothing to win. Might still be a good fight. Yeah. I ju... I just brought you up to welterweight. Too good to fight these contenders, you'd rather fight some bullshit champ? Didn't notice I was fighting any contenders. Well, you can get yourself another manager any time you want. In fact, if you'd learnt to protect your face a little better, I wouldn't have to turn down this money. My face out there so much, it's a miracle I ain't been knocked out yet, boss. No you can't work here anymore tonight. I made us a reservation. You um... You might want to shower. Here you go. Here you go. What's this? Well, ain't no big secret what you're wishing for. Go on and blow. Thank you. 33 ain't so old. I was still fighting at 39. Fought for 23 years. How's it going, Scrap? Ah, doin' good, Mickey. Doin' good. What are you having? Coffee. You two not speaking? Don't hardly know him. I met Frankie right after my 37th birthday. He was picking up cut work. He used to patch me up when I thought it was impossible. Good man to have in your corner. Yes, he is. He stayed with me through my last fight in San Berdoo. My manager was off getting drunk somewhere and... it was just Frankie and me. I was taking a hellacious beating. Everybody's got a particular number of fights in 'em. Nobody tells you what that number is. Mine was 109. I just didn't want to admit it.",

        "And no matter how hard you work at it, you just can't stop the bleeding. Did you write your daughter? Every week. I've no idea why you come to church. After her 12th straight knockout, Frankie got a couple of real good offers. The first was to fight Billie, \"The Blue Bear\", Osterman for the WBA welterweight title. Billie the Blue Bear! Billie was a former prostitute out of East Berlin. Had a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks. Didn't matter to her, something like that could kill a person. And the crowds loved her. He turned it down without even telling her. The next was to fight the British champ, a Jamaican girl Billie just beat. Hello? Not interested. He turned that down too. That's a lot of money, boss. Yeah. You're making money. What're you still working here for? It's a title match, right? Are you British? It's a title you can't take away. She's got nothing to lose, you got nothing to win. Might still be a good fight. Yeah. I ju... I just brought you up to welterweight. Too good to fight these contenders, you'd rather fight some bullshit champ? Didn't notice I was fighting any contenders. Well, you can get yourself another manager any time you want. In fact, if you'd learnt to protect your face a little better, I wouldn't have to turn down this money. My face out there so much, it's a miracle I ain't been knocked out yet, boss. No you can't work here anymore tonight. I made us a reservation. You um... You might want to shower. Here you go. Here you go. What's this? Well, ain't no big secret what you're wishing for. Go on and blow. Thank you. 33 ain't so old. I was still fighting at 39. Fought for 23 years. How's it going, Scrap? Ah, doin' good, Mickey. Doin' good. What are you having? Coffee. You two not speaking? Don't hardly know him. I met Frankie right after my 37th birthday. He was picking up cut work. He used to patch me up when I thought it was impossible. Good man to have in your corner. Yes, he is. He stayed with me through my last fight in San Berdoo. My manager was off getting drunk somewhere and... it was just Frankie and me. I was taking a hellacious beating. Everybody's got a particular number of fights in 'em. Nobody tells you what that number is. Mine was 109. I just didn't want to admit it."

Me and Mardell'd bust up laughing, watching him scoot across the kitchen floor. Daddy, he was so sick by then, he couldn't hardly stand himself, but one morning, he got up and carried Axel to his rig, and the two of them went off into the woods, singing and howling."

If she dies today, you know what her last thought will be? \"I think I did all right. \" I know I could rest with that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna get a cup of coffee. Yeah. All right. I'm gonna disconnect your air machine, then you're gonna go to sleep. Then I'll give you a shot, and you'll... stay asleep. \"Mo cuishle\"... ...means \"my darling, my blood. \" He gave her a single shot. It was enough adrenaline to do the job a few times over.

        "But that... But now she wants to die, and I just want to keep her with me. Oh. And I swear to God, Father, it's... it's committing a sin by doing it. By keeping her alive, I'm killing her. Know what I mean? How do I get around that? You don't. You step aside, Frankie. You leave her with God. She's not asking for God's help; she's asking for mine. Frankie, I've seen you at Mass almost every day for 23 years. The only person comes to church that much is the kind who can't forgive himself for something. Whatever sins you're carrying, they're nothing compared to this. Forget about God... or Heaven and Hell.
