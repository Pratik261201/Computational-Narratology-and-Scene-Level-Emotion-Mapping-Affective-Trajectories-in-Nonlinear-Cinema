Give us this day our daily bread... ...and forgive us our trespasses... ...as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation... ...but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours... ...now and forever. Amen. (BIRD SQUAWKING) (THUNDER RUMBLES) WEATHERMAN: Looking at mostly cloudy skies and with lows in the upper 20s... ...there will be some refreeze on some of the roads... ...so slick spots are possible tonight in isolated... You know the most important thing your granddad ever taught me? Hmm? Be ready. Hurricane, flood, whatever it ends up being. No more food gets delivered to the grocery store, gas stations dry up. People just turn on each other, and, uh... All of a sudden, all that stands between you and being dead is you. I'm proud of you, son. It was a nice shot. (GENE MacLELLAN'S \"PUT YOUR HAND IN THE HAND\" PLAYING OVER THE RADIO) Put your hand in the hand of the man Who stilled the water Put your hand in the hand of the man Who calmed the sea Take a look at yourself And you can look at others differently (DOG BARKING) Every time I look into the holy book I wanna tremble GRACE: Hey, come on, hon. (ANNA HUMMING) GRACE: Wait. I forgot something. Hold on a second, Anna! KELLER: Ralph, you have the venison? RALPH: Yup. GRACE: I forgot the pie. (ANNA CONTINUES HUMMING) Are we taking the truck? We're going up the street, you dope. Come on. GRACE: Hey, wait for your mother, please. Give me a ride. KELLER: Oh, you're getting heavy. RALPH: Danny's dad said he'd sell me their old car. I got half of what I need saved from the summer. - I thought maybe... - Forget it. I can barely get enough carpentry work to keep up with the mortgage. Why don't you rent out Grandpa's old apartment house? (GRACE CHUCKLES) Like I keep telling your mother, it's an old building. It'll cost a fortune to fix it up. KELLER: Oh. (RALPH COUGHS) (DOORBELL RINGING) KELLER: Hey. GRACE: Okay, okay. NANCY: They're here! (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING FROM SPEAKER) GRACE: - Hello. - Happy Thanksgiving. KELLER: Anna, wait until we're invited. For God's sake, Keller. Get the hell in here.",

Come on! Christ!  LOKI: Come here. Come here.  Stay. If you move, I'll put a bullet through your fucking head.  This is 13-40. I need additional unit for search. 437 Carrol Street. Possible kidnapping victims on the premises.    Anna? Fucking... Anna? Joy? Fuck. Fuck.    Aah! Fuck!   Ah, fuck.  LOKI: So we've taken photographs of some of the clothing we found in the suspect's house.    LOKI: Mr. Dover. Mr. Dover, is your wife here? She's not coming. If you can't make a positive ID on these photographs... ...I'm gonna need her to come in and take a look at them. Have a seat. So he confessed? He said he killed them? We were hoping he was lying, but... We haven't even found any bodies, Mr. Dover, but... ...the Birches positively identified two pieces of clothing. So I'm gonna need you to tell me if you recognize anything.  No. Uh... I'm not sure. I don't know. Okay. No. No...  That's her... That's her sock. You... You wasted time. You wasted time following me."
