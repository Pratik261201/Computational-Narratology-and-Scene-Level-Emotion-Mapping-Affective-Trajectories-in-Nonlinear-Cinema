      "raw_text": "Yes, Marlin. I see it. It's beautiful. So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think you were going to get the whole ocean, did you? Oh, yeah! A fish can breathe out here. Did your man deliver or did he deliver? - My man delivered. - It wasn't so easy. A lot of clownfish had their eyes on this place. You better believe they did. Every single one of them. You did good and the neighbourhood is awesome. - So you do like it, don't you? - No, no, I really do like it. But, Marlin, I know that the Drop Off is desirable, great schools, amazing view, but do we really need so much space? Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and see a whale right by their bedroom window! - You're going to wake the kids. - Oh, right. Right. Look. They're dreaming. - We still have to name them. - All of them? Right now? All right. We'll name this half Marlin Jr. and this half Coral Jr. - Okay, we're done. - I like Nemo. Nemo? We'll name one Nemo, but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr. In a couple of days, we're going to be parents! Yeah. - What if they don't like me? - Marlin... There's over 400 eggs. Odds are one of them is bound to like you. What? - You remember how we met? - I try not to. Well, I remember. Excuse me, miss. Can you see if I have a hook in my lip? - Marlin. - Look closer. - Get away! - Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go? Coral, get inside the house. No, don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside. You. Right now. No! Coral! Coral? Coral! Coral? There, there. It's okay. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise I will never let anything happen to you, Nemo. First day of school! Wake up! Come on. First day of school. I don't want to go to school. - Not you, Dad. Me. - Okay. Get up! Time for school! - All right, I'm up. It's time for school. - Oh, boy! Nemo! - First day of school! - Don't move. You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. - You feel a break? - No. Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area. Any rushing fluids? - No. - How many stripes do I have? - Answer the question. - Three. No! Something's wrong with you. I have one, two... Three. That's all I have? You're okay. How's the lucky fin? - Lucky. - Let's see. Sure you want to go to school this year?",

Do you want this anemone to sting you? - Yes. - Brush. - I'm done. - You missed a spot. - Where? - There. Right there. And here and here. We're excited. First day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn. What do we have to remember about the ocean? - It's not safe. - That's my boy. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in. Then we go out and back in. Then one more time. Out and back in. - If you want to do it four times... - Dad... All right. Come on, boy. Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark. - I doubt that. - Have you ever met a shark? - No, and I don't plan to. - How old are sea turtles? Sea turtles? I don't know. Sandy Plankton from next door said that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him, after I'm done talking to the shark. Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold my fin. Hold my fin. You're not going to freak out like you did at the petting zoo. That snail was about to charge. I wonder where we're supposed to go. - Bye, Mom. - I'll pick you up after school. Come on, you guys. Stop it. Give it back. Come on. We'll try over there. Excuse me. Is this where we meet his teacher? - Look who's out of the anemone. - Yes, shocking, I know. - Marty? - Marlin. - Bob. - Ted. Phil. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Tell us a joke. - Yeah. - Good idea. That's a misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish. - Come on, Clowny. - Do something funny. All right. I know one joke. There's a mollusk. He walks up to... Well, he swims up. Actually, the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place. And then the sea cucumber... I'm mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. None of them were walking... Sheldon! Get out of Mr Johanssen's yard now! All right, you kids! Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Can I go play, too? Can I? I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds. That's where I would play. - What's wrong with his fin? - He looks funny. - Hey, what did I do? - Be nice. It's his first time at school. He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin. Dad... See this tentacle? It's shorter than all my other tentacles. But you can't really tell. Especially when I twirl them like this.",

Good thing I was here. - He wasn't going to go. - He was too afraid. - I wasn't. - This does not concern you. You're lucky I don't tell your parents. You can't swim well. - I can swim fine, Dad, okay? - No. It's not okay. You shouldn't be near here. You'll start school in a year or two. No. Just because you're scared of the ocean... Clearly you're not ready. You think you can do these things, but you just can't! I hate you. There's... Nothing to see. Gather there. Anything I can do? I am a scientist. Is there any problem? I didn't mean to interrupt. He isn't a good swimmer. I think it's too soon for him to be out here unsupervised. I can assure you, he's quite safe with me. I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. Oh, my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea. Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're going to get stuck and I'm going to have to get you before another fish does. Get back here. I said get back here now! Stop. You take one more move, mister... Don't you dare.

Good thing I was here. - He wasn't going to go. - He was too afraid. - I wasn't. - This does not concern you. You're lucky I don't tell your parents. You can't swim well. - I can swim fine, Dad, okay? - No. It's not okay. You shouldn't be near here. You'll start school in a year or two. No. Just because you're scared of the ocean... Clearly you're not ready. You think you can do these things, but you just can't! I hate you. There's... Nothing to see. Gather there. Anything I can do? I am a scientist. Is there any problem? I didn't mean to interrupt. He isn't a good swimmer. I think it's too soon for him to be out here unsupervised. I can assure you, he's quite safe with me. I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. Oh, my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea. Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're going to get stuck and I'm going to have to get you before another fish does. Get back here. I said get back here now! Stop. You take one more move, mister... Don't you dare.

Your dad's probably back at the pet store. Pet store? - Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart. - Pet Palace. - Fish-O-Rama. - Mail order. eBay. - Which one is it? - I'm from the ocean. The ocean. The ocean! He hasn't been decontaminated yet. Jacques! Clean him! Ocean. Voilà. He is clean. Wow. The big blue. What's it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If there's anything you need, ask your Auntie Deb. That's me. If I'm not around you can always talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's nuts. - Can't hear you, Peach. - I said we got a live one. - Yes! - Boy, oh, boy. - What have we got? - Root canal. It's not going to be pretty. - Clamp installed? - Yup. - What did he use to open? - Glidden drill. He favours that one. I can't see, Flo. - Schilder Technique. - That's a Hedstrom file. That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex. It's got a teardrop cross section. A Hedstrom. - K-Flex! - Hedstrom! There I go. Little help. Over here. I'll go deflate him. All right. Go ahead and rinse. The human mouth is a disgusting place. - Nigel. - What did I miss? - Root canal. A doozy. - What did he use to open? - Glidden drill. - He favours it. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus. - Hello. Who's this? - New guy. - The dentist took him off the reef. - An outie. From my neck of the woods? Sorry if I took a snap at you. Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat. No, no. Those aren't your fish. They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo. The picture broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. Going to be eight this week. Hey, little fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She's going to be here Friday to pick you up. You're her present. It's our little secret. Well, Mr Tucker, while that sets up, I'm going to go see a man about a wallaby. Darla! - What's wrong with her? - She wouldn't stop shaking the bag. - Poor Chuckles. - He was her present last year. Hitched a ride on the porcelain express. She's a fish killer. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad. - Daddy! Help me! - He's stuck. Nobody touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out."

Where's the butter? - It's on the tip of my tongue. - Lobster. - Saw that. - What? - Lots of legs. - Clam? Close enough. It's a whale of a tale I'll tell you, lad - They're good. - Somebody give me directions? \"Would somebody give me directions?\" - I'm serious. - Blah, blah, me, me. Blah, blah, blah, me, me. Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey, come back. What's the matter? While they're doing impressions, I am miles from home with a fish that can't even remember her own name. - I bet that's frustrating. - My son is out there. - Your son Chico? - Nemo. It doesn't matter. 'Cause no fish in this ocean is going to help me. I'm helping you. Wait right here. - Guys. - Is he bothering you again? No, he's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his son Fabio. Heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney? Sydney? Oh, sure. Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted? - Sure do. - Hey, they know Sydney! - You wouldn't know how to get there?"

I've got to clean the fish tank before Darla gets here. - You hear that, Sharkbait? - Yay! He's going to clean the tank! Yeah, we're going to be clean! Ready to see your dad? Course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbour waiting for you right now. Yeah. Here comes a big one! Come on. You got to try this. - Will you just stop it? - Why? What's wrong? - We're in a whale. Don't you get it? - A whale? A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help. And now we're stuck here. - A whale? You know, I speak whale. - You're insane. You can't speak whale. I have to get out. I have to find my son. I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! Hey. You okay? There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay. No. It won't. Sure it will. You'll see. No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him. That's a funny thing to promise. What? You can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little Harpo. - What's going on? - Don't know. I'll ask him. - What's... - Dory. ...going on? - I think he says we've stopped. - Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to speak whale. You're going to make things worse. What is that noise? Oh, no. Look what you did. The water's going down. It's going down! - Really? You sure about that? - Look. Already it's half-empty. - I'd say it's half-full. - Stop that. It's half-empty! Okay, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat or he wants a root beer float. Of course he wants us to go there. That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good? Tell him I'm not interested in being lunch. - Okay. He's... - Stop talking to him. - What is going on? - I'll check. What... No. No more whale. You can't speak whale. Yes, I can. No, you can't. You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nemo. - Okay. - Dory! He says it's time to let go. Everything's going to be all right. How do you know? How do you know something bad isn't going to happen?",
