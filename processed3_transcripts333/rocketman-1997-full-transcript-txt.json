Retrofire ignition in T-minus six and counting. Five, four, three, - two, one, ignition! - (BUZZING) Houston, we have a problem. We have a problem! Mission Control, the gyro is out! The gyro is out! Houston, we have a problem! We have a problem! I want my mommy! I want my mommy! - FRED: Uh-oh. - MRS. RANDALL: Fred Z. Randall. What are you doing? I come in peace. Look, George. It's our little moon man. Sweet pickled pineapples! Why can't he play football, like the rest of the kids? MRS. RANDALL: George. BILL: Houston, request go for landing. Pilgrim One, requests go for landing. Go is affirmative. MAN: Pilgrim One, you are go for landing. BILL: Roger that, Houston. MAN: Aeroshell deployed. Deceleration rate, normal. ECLSS is go. Pilgrim is through the high gate at 80 percent. Heartbeat steady. My man is made of ice. (SIREN BLARING) - GARY: Bill? - I see it. GARY: Houston request, 20 percent X gimbal correction. - Tell them no. - Negative. Pilgrim, hold your transfer ellipse steady. What's going on Hackman? GARY: This isn't right. Computer says, we're coming in too steep. Twenty thousand meters. Pilgrim dropping rapidly to Martian surface. Glide slope is eroding. - JULIE: APUs are go. - Gary? Increase 20 percent. Do it now, or we'll burn up. BILL: Going to manual. Why is he course correcting? Why is he course correcting? - Can someone answer me, please? - I don't know. Engaging landing thrusters. Houston, we're off course. - Come on. - (SIREN BLARING) BILL: We're losing her. We're losing, man. We're losing her! - BILL: Houston... - (STATIC) Why? Congratulations, you're all dead! Oh. Third time in a row, Hackman! Nice move on that course correction! Paul, it wasn't his fault. That's right, the navigation computer keeps telling me to correct it. It's obviously screwed up. Oh, that's the problem? Pardon me! If Gary says, the computer's screwing up, then the computer is screwing up, now why don't you just fix it? Get me the name of the guy that wrote this software!",

(HOOTING) I'm training him using calls that he's familiar with to retrieve specific rock samples from underground fissures. (HOOTING) Of course. There's still moisture under the surface. FRED: And where there's water, there could be life. JULIE: That's right. Good boy. Or death. Death to anyone who dare to disturb the vicious Martian crust devils with their venomous feet and their wet, sucking lips! (SNORTING) - Uh, Paul? - Yeah? Paul, can I talk to you for a second? Sure.

I mean, what is your reasoning here, Paul? Little Dr. Zaius. (HOOTING) Because we're going to Mars, we should take along a guy from Mars? (HOOTING) He's a computer genius. He's supposed to be a little weird. A little? Let go of me! I am not gonna let a few random personality quirks ground the most important mission of my career! (SCREAMING) Well, Paul, excuse me for... for letting my practical concerns get in the way of your career! Wait, wait, this mission means just as much to you as to me, Ford! And if Gordon can't cut it, then this kid is our last hope. Well, that's impressive. They're bonding already. FRED: Mom, please! I really wish you'd stop referring to it as \"running away from home.\" It's only temporary. Going to Mars is not temporary, Freddy. The last time you ran away, it was just to the garage. Oh, I know. You're rebelling, aren't you? Mom, I don't even know if I'm going to Mars for sure. Oh. Well, I wish I was. I've made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, just like you like them. It's a long trip. Mom, I'm not even hungry, honestly. Look, there's a little moon, a star and a little rocket.",

        "ten, 15 years.  Who are you?  I'm Fred Rand... Fred Rand... That's Fred Randall. Fred Randall. Fred, meet your new roommate. Julie Ford, mission specialist, geologist. It's gonna be a real honor sleeping with you.  In completely different beds. Fred, she's not your roommate. He is.  I get it. I get it! Haze the rookie! Good one! The legendary rooming-with-the-monkey gag! Ulysses is a chimp, not a monkey. He's a ch... And he's the key to discovering life on Mars.  I'm training him using calls that he's familiar with to retrieve specific rock samples from underground fissures.  Of course. There's still moisture under the surface. FRED: And where there's water, there could be life. JULIE: That's right. Good boy. Or death. Death to anyone who dare to disturb the vicious Martian crust devils with their venomous feet and their wet, sucking lips!  - Uh, Paul? - Yeah? Paul, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Well, it looks like it's me and you, my little Ewok. FRED: You're gonna be my very first roommate! - So, what do you think? - What do I think? What do you think? I mean, what is your reasoning here, Paul? Little Dr. Zaius.  Because we're going to Mars, we should take along a guy from Mars?  He's a computer genius. He's supposed to be a little weird. A little? Let go of me! I am not gonna let a few random personality quirks ground the most important mission of my career!  Well, Paul, excuse me for... for letting my practical concerns get in the way of your career! Wait, wait, this mission means just as much to you as to me, Ford! And if Gordon can't cut it, then this kid is our last hope. Well, that's impressive. They're bonding already. FRED: Mom, please! I really wish you'd stop referring to it as \"running away from home.\" It's only temporary. Going to Mars is not temporary, Freddy. The last time you ran away, it was just to the garage. Oh, I know. You're rebelling, aren't you? Mom, I don't even know if I'm going to Mars for sure. Oh. Well, I wish I was. I've made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, just like you like them. It's a long trip. Mom, I'm not even hungry, honestly. Look, there's a little moon, a star and a little rocket."

Tennis racket stuck to the back of a... It's no good... Bubbling out of my sister's... Brazilian donkey! I don't think I can make myself any clearer! Wick, get 'em off that planet! Do as he says, Paul. Ben, we had no way of knowing. I followed procedure, Ben. PAUL: I followed procedure, here! Paul, unplug and go home. Unplug and go home? Nesbitt, you're in command. FRED: Houston, do you copy? Houston, come in! MAN: Pilgrim we copy. Please stand by. BUD: Don't stare at me, people! We got a crew out there! Let's bring 'em home. JULIE: Houston, wind speed continues to increase. - This is bad, Paul. - Ford, it's Bud. Listen carefully. If the wind keeps building at this rate, in 20 minutes, liftoff will be impossible. Launch now. No! Commander Overbeck and Ulysses are still out there! They're lost now. You're not. Launch! - I'm going after them. - What? BUD: Fred? Fred, answer me!"
