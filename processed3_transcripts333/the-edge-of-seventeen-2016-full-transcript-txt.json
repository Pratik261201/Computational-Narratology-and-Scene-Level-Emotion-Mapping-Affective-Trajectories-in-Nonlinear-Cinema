You should go for as long as you want. Very funny. I'm gonna be back on Sunday. Okay? Just in time to surprise you. Oh, I tried to call Darian, but he must be in his AP study group. I'll tell him. Be good. (DOOR CLOSES) (LAUGHS) (CELL PHONE RINGING) What? Huh? Dibs. Dibs, dibs, dibs! What are you even saying? 0h. Mom's fucking a dentist in Manzanita for two days, so I call dibs on the house, okay? Ew. Bye! Dude, you are so sick for saying it like that. Mom's boobs are jangling around a dentist's face.

You know, it's kind of poofy, and I don't know. Do my arms look bad? No.  Yeah, you don't sound very believable, and you're making me nervous, Nadine. Your upper arms are breathtaking. Where are you going? Well, it's last minute, but Brent called me. The dentist one. And he asked if I wanted to go to Manzanita for the weekend, and I thought, \"You know what? \"I deserve to be a little selfish once in a while, so...\" Yeah. You should go for as long as you want. Very funny. I'm gonna be back on Sunday. Okay? Just in time to surprise you. Oh, I tried to call Darian, but he must be in his AP study group. I'll tell him. Be good.    What? Huh? Dibs. Dibs, dibs, dibs! What are you even saying? 0h. Mom's fucking a dentist in Manzanita for two days, so I call dibs on the house, okay? Ew. Bye! Dude, you are so sick for saying it like that. Mom's boobs are jangling around a dentist's face. See it, Darian. See Mom's titties all up in that dentist's face.    Ow!  Oh, my God, I love you. I love those teeth in your mouth. That's your nose. You just picked my nose.   No way. Mmm-mmm, BOY: Do a gainer! KRISTA: Where are you going? Darian!   Darian! You need to get all these people out of the pool. Excuse me, all of you need to leave. Bye-bye! Hey. no one's listening to you."
