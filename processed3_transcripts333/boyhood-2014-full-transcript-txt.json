Well, I think it must be, if you flick water into the air just right, it'll turn into a wasp. Hey! Yep. That's cool. So, how was your day at school? Fine. I had a good meeting with Miss Butler this time. I kind of liked her. What'd she say? Well, she said that you weren't turning in your homework assignments. And I told her, \"I know he does them,\" \"'cause I check them every night.\" She said she found a big chunk of them crumpled up at the bottom of your backpack. She didn't ask for 'em. Baby, she doesn't have to. You're just supposed to turn them in. And she said you're still staring out the window all day. Not all day. And she said that you destroyed her pencil sharpener. Not on purpose! Wait! She said that you crammed a bunch of rocks in it. I thought if we could sharpen pencils, maybe we could sharpen rocks. Well, what were you gonna do with a bunch of sharpened rocks? I was trying to make arrowheads for my rock collection. Dude, my turn! Hold on. Mason! Samantha! Tommy! Is Mason down there? Yeah. Well, tell him he has to come home to dinner. Okay. Hey. Hey, sweetie. Why aren't you ready? Hey, Mason. Hey, Ted. Come on, hurry up. Let's go. What time is it? It's 9:00. Let's go, let's go! Okay, I meant to call you, 'cause Janice flaked out. I don't have a sitter. Why didn't you call somebody else? I can't get a babysitter now. It's 9:00. But you're welcome to hang out with us. Well, no! I mean, we have plans. The guys are expecting me. Well, you can go. All right. I'll come back in a couple of hours. Is that okay? Yeah. Yes, it's okay. All right. \"'Turn back! Turn back! I don't wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle.\" \"'Who? said Harry, as they backtracked quickly.\" \"'She haunts one of the toilets\" \"in the girls' bathroom on the first floor, said Hermione.\" \"'She haunts a toilet?\" \"Yes, it's been out of order all year,\" \"'because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place!\" \"'I never went in there anyway, if I could avoid it.\" \"'It's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you.\"' Why can't you just say that? I'm sorry. - I don't wanna go with you. - You're sorry, that's bullshit! That's right. I wanna stay here with my kids.",

Baby, we can email them or write. We can come back to visit. And guess what? This place that Grandma found us, you'll each have your own room. Right? And there's a pool. Mom, do you still love Dad?

No. Did he sit around playing video games with Mason the whole time? Yeah. You were supposed to finish that by the time I got back. Remember? Hey. Grievous is the best, man. Yoda! No, Yoda is, man! Yoda! Yoda, man. He has four arms. Yoda, represent! I hate Miss Burnsby. Everybody's been saying she's lesbian. She is. She hit on Stacey. Man, that's gross. Think it's true?

Now, if the Astros could just get a few runs, maybe we'd win a game. Dad, do you have a job? Why would you ask me that? I don't know. Mom wanted to know, and I didn't know what the answer was. Mom wanted to know. All right. Well, you can tell Mom that I just happen to have passed my second actuarial exam, all right? So, tell her that. How's she doing? Is she finishing school? Yep, all A's. All A's? Like mother, like daughter, right? He got that! That's out... Yeah! Look at that! Yeah! Mason! Yes! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! - Hey, Jimmy. - Hey, Samantha! Hey. What's up, Jimmy?

I know what this party is. The parents are out of town, right? Somebody's scored a keg, right? You guys are gonna have a good time, trash the whole house. Right? Am I right? No. No, Dad. Amy's really responsible. Who's gonna be there? Marie, Christine, Amy. Everyone. Is that guy on your Facebook page, is he gonna be there? Who? Come on, the guy that's got his arm wrapped around you, with his hair over his eyes. Garret? Garret. Is that his name? All right. Is Garret gonna be there? Probably. Probably. You see? I learn more about her from her Facebook page than I do from our scintillating conversation. Is he your boyfriend? Kind of. Have you met him? Has he been around the house? Sometimes. Sometimes? Zzz? You have a boyfriend! Wow. Have you heard of Sarah Palin? Yes. What's the one thing you know about Sarah Palin's 17-year-old daughter? She's pregnant? That's right. And what is the one thing that you are not going to be in a couple of years when you turn 17? Pregnant? That's right! All right, now, what are the two ways that you can achieve that goal? First is not have any sex, okay? That's the first way, okay? Just not engage in that. That did not work out very well for your mother and me. And what's the second way? Where you going? Bathroom. You don't have to go to the bathroom. Sit down, Mason, just sit down. What's the second way? Has your mother talked to you guys about this stuff? No, Dad! No, come on, has she talked to you about contraception? What, has she... Condoms? She talked about that? No, Dad, please, stop. What? Does Garret have a condom? God! Dad! What? Come on. Sam, we have to be able to talk about this, all right? Come on, we do. We can do it, we can do it. Just stay with me here, all right? It's as hard for me as it is for you. But seriously, all right? I read an article in the paper the other day that said that although US teenagers are not the most sexually active, we have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy, okay?"

But for some reason, you know, they hated the lemon-lime flavor. I don't know what it was. Yeah. Couldn't give it away. How long were you over there? I did two tours in Iraq and one in Bosnia. Wow. Did you enlist? Yeah, I was, um, Army National Guard, and, you know, coming straight out of high school, needed money for college. Seemed like a decent paying job. And, did my tour. And whenever I got done I told them, if there's a world-changing event, I'll come back. And, three months later 9/11 happened, and I was back 9/12.

Like, the guys that came along after us and replaced us, they didn't listen to any of our advice. They did, basically, the polar opposite of what we did, and they lost seven guys in the first month. Wow. What did you guys do differently? I like to think it's just a matter of mutual respect, you know. All the time we spent over there building trust, these guys basically destroyed it in three days. So, what did the locals think about why we're there? Oil, plain and simple. Hey, Mason. One last hit. Hey. Mickey Mouse Club. Get the fuck out of my car. Just crawl out the back window or something, man. I'm gonna miss you. I'll see you on Sunday night. All right. You better text me. Do you have any gum? Um... Yeah, I do, actually. Here you go. Thanks. See ya. And they're buying this party line that they're supposed to feel bad and trade off their own pension, as if that's what's been corrupting this nation. Yeah, because those who heart Fox, in my opinion, are being lied to. Yeah, thank God for Wisconsin. We have to follow that example. You're right. Hey, Mason, what time is it? Like 12:15. Happy birthday. Happy birthday! Mason. It's your birthday? Just now, I guess. Yeah, how old are you? Fifteen. Fifteen. Give me a hug. Happy birthday. My goodness!",

No, I didn't. I never said that. I remember.

Second of all, I would never say that. Never. You did, though. What? Mason. Come on, what about your sister? I'm just gonna forget about her? Come on, how's that fair? Anthony Nagar. What...

No, but she's coming to Houston in April. She's coming to Houston? Your dad and I could get you tickets and you could stay with us. That'd be great! Yeah. - Hey, Annie? - Yup.

Very arranged and very organized, over and over again by your loving father. Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at that, look at that. Top of Volume II, first four tracks, you've got Band on the Run into My Sweet Lord into Jealous Guy into Photograph. Come on! It's like the perfect segue. You got Paul, who takes you to the party, George who talks to you about God, John is just, \"No, it's about love and pain,\" and then Ringo who just says, \"Hey. Can't we enjoy what we have while we have it?\" It's a good record. I shit you not. Cool. Hey, there, Cliff. Hey, how you doing? Good. How you doing? Hi, birthday boy! It's good to see you.

I hope you like it. I heard you didn't have one, so. It's a Bible. This is your first Bible. Look, there's your name. Wow. In gold. And wait, wait, wait. Look at this. It's a red-letter edition, and that means that everything that Jesus said is in red. Thank you. You like it? All right. I love you, sweetie. Happy birthday. And this one's from us. Yeah, here.

And there's this decade of music out there that's been scattered, all right, and now it has been carefully found, arranged and ordered for you by your loving father. Very arranged and very organized, over and over again by your loving father. Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at that, look at that. Top of Volume II, first four tracks, you've got Band on the Run into My Sweet Lord into Jealous Guy into Photograph. Come on! It's like the perfect segue. You got Paul, who takes you to the party, George who talks to you about God, John is just, \"No, it's about love and pain,\" and then Ringo who just says, \"Hey. Can't we enjoy what we have while we have it?\" It's a good record. I shit you not. Cool. Hey, there, Cliff. Hey, how you doing? Good. How you doing? Hi, birthday boy! It's good to see you. It's great to see you. Yeah. You made it all right? Yeah, we sure did. We sure did. How are you, darling? Let's just get this one... All right, we ready? Yeah. Wait. Hey, Sam. Wait, wait, wait. Come on. Hey, still sleeping here? Yeah. Hey, buddy. Make a wish, make a wish. Real good! Presents! Wait, wait, wait. Here, sweetie. Sam, would you get us a knife so we can cut this up? All right. I hope you like it. I heard you didn't have one, so. It's a Bible. This is your first Bible. Look, there's your name. Wow. In gold. And wait, wait, wait. Look at this. It's a red-letter edition, and that means that everything that Jesus said is in red. Thank you. You like it? All right. I love you, sweetie. Happy birthday. And this one's from us. Yeah, here. It's not going to make all your dreams come true here. Just keep your expectations low. No, you need it. It's... Come on, right? You gotta have it. You need this. You got life ahead of you.

It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive to actually build cyborgs and robots. I mean, the costs of that were impossible. They decided to just let humans turn themselves into robots. That's what's going on right now. Right now? Yeah! I mean, why not? They're billions of us just laying around, not really doing anything.

Seriously. I read this thing the other day about how... When you hear that ding on your inbox, you get like a dopamine rush in your brain. It's like we're being chemically rewarded for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed. How evil is that? We're fucked. So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that? Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year and everyone just hated him? You made more fun of him than anyone. I still make fun of Trevor though. It was like he was so pathetically desperate for attention. Or to be different, or something. That's just 'cause they did that lame story about it in the school paper. And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later. That's the thing, though, I'm not doing it for attention. I just wanna try and not live my life through a screen. I want some kind of actual interaction. A real person, not just the profile they put up. I'm sorry. Were you saying something? Yeah, okay, I know you're joking. But, I mean, it's kind of true.

I just don't get why you're being so fucking childish. I'm not being childish! You're the one who made it into this big thing by telling everyone! I haven't told anyone. So Cynthia just magically knows you're going to the prom with this loser, even though you're not dating him anymore? She's my best friend. Well, your best friend has a big fucking mouth. Take it up with her, then. Why don't you just tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaw she can keep on talking, as long as she includes the truth, which is that we wouldn't be having this conversation if your college boyfriend weren't out of town this weekend. You had already bought the tickets. It's just prom, it's not like it matters. I'm just trying to be friends with you. It's just humiliating. I can't do that. Mister I-Don't-Care-What-Anyone-Else-Thinks-Of-Me. Fuck anyone else! I care what I think of me, which isn't much right now. King of the Pity Prom. Fine. We're not going. Great. Why are we even... I mean, we both knew this was coming. I'm just the one who did something about it. Yeah, fucking some college guy. Fuck you! I don't regret anything. Of course you don't.

Take it up with her, then. Why don't you just tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaw she can keep on talking, as long as she includes the truth, which is that we wouldn't be having this conversation if your college boyfriend weren't out of town this weekend. You had already bought the tickets. It's just prom, it's not like it matters. I'm just trying to be friends with you. It's just humiliating. I can't do that. Mister I-Don't-Care-What-Anyone-Else-Thinks-Of-Me. Fuck anyone else! I care what I think of me, which isn't much right now. King of the Pity Prom. Fine. We're not going. Great. Why are we even... I mean, we both knew this was coming. I'm just the one who did something about it. Yeah, fucking some college guy. Fuck you! I don't regret anything. Of course you don't.

These high school love things, they never work out. Here, come here. I mean, everybody's just changing so much, you know? The odds of two young people staying on the same wavelength are... Yeah, but still... Look, and I also guarantee you that every day of your life that you spend crying over some silly girl is a complete waste of time. She wasn't a silly girl, though. I mean, she's a serious person. And I really thought we were... What? I don't know. Here's the truth. Women are never satisfied, okay? They're always looking to potentially trade up, and that's, I'm sorry to say, what I think has happened to you, my fine-feathered friend. What does that even mean? It means don't hand over the controls to your self-esteem to Sheila. Sheena. All right. It means you are responsible for you, not your girlfriend, not your mom, not me, you. And if you truly take care of you, you will be amazed at how much girls like Sheena start lining up at your front door. Great. You just gotta separate yourself from the pack in some way."

If we leave now we can catch the late afternoon at Big Bend. You ever been before, man? Yeah, but not since I was really little. Then all the more reason to come now, man. That's why we're here, dude. Mason, this is Nicole, Barb's roommate. Hey, what's up? Hi. Mason, Nicole. So, you game? Sure. Here, have the rest of this. Got it timed perfectly. It'll kick in when we get in the mountains. Awesome. Let's go. Do they let you major in that here? Well, it's not that serious here, so I kinda train outside of university, but I'm taking all my basics like History of Dance and all that. Nice. Yeah. What do you teach? Gosh. Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop. Wow... Which one's your favorite? Tap. Yeah? Yeah. You get to like make up all your own sounds, and there's no rules. Just like creative freedom. That's great. Yeah. That's why I love teaching it, 'cause, I don't know, it's so beautiful to me, and it's kind of dying away in this generation, so, to be a part of bringing it back to the kids is really rewarding. Right, keeps it going. Yeah. How old are they? Six to eight. Wow. Yeah. They have no fear, and they're not self-conscious at all. They haven't reached the awkward years yet. Yeah, not yet. It's coming. Hey. Hey. Dalton can be crazy sometimes. He seems cool, though. Yeah. Yeah, they're both really cool. How are you feeling? Great. Pretty great, to be honest. Good. I'm really happy that you're hangin' out with us. Yeah. Me, too. This moment's having a falsieful whoregasm! It's like as if all of time has unfolded before us so we could stand here and look out and scream, \"Fuck, yeah!\" You know how everyone's always saying, \"Seize the moment\"? I don't know, I'm kinda thinking it's the other way around. You know, like, the moment seizes us. Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's constant. The moment, it's just... It's like it's always right now, you know? Yeah.",
