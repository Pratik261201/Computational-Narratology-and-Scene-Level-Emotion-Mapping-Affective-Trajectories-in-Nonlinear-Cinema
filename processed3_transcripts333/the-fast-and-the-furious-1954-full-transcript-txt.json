I talk to people all the time and I get to figuring 'em out, too. - You wanna take my money? - Yeah. This guy don't seem much interested in the case. - I wonder if you could get the pineapple juice? Now? - Sure, lady, be right back. - Hitchhiking? - Nope. - I didn't see your car out there. - I'm walking. - Oh, I'll give you a lift. What's your name? Bob Nielson's mine. - Myers, Bill Myers. - Myers, huh? Where you from? - You ask a lot of questions, Mr. Nielson, but I'm from El Centro. - Hmm. Right near where Webster killed that guy, huh? You know him, Webster? - Nope. - Hear about it? - How can I help? - Interested? - No. No, I'm not. - If I'm giving you a lift, Myers, I'd like to see your identification. - I didn't say I wanted a lift. - Maybe I better see it anyway. - Sure. - Oh, no you don't. - Stop it, both of you! (grunting) He's hurt. We better get a doctor. - Come on. - Where do you think you're going? - Mexico. - You're not gonna leave that man here. - With you. Give me the car keys. - Webster? - Come on. (tense instrumental music) - Well, I had to turn everything upside down, but I finally found... Well, where is everybody? (dramatic instrumental music) Oh! Oh. Operator. Operator, get me the police. Right away, quick. Hello, hello, police? This is Wilma Belding at the Saddle Peak Lodge Cafe. Yeah, yeah, Wilma, W-I-L-- What? I wanna re, a repor, I wanna report a murder. Yes, a murder! I can't tell you about it on the phone. Highway 74. Oh, for heaven's sake, hurry up. - It's a police car. (siren blaring) - I've got a bullet for them and one for you. You're gonna see a lot of cops and lots of people before we cross the border. Just behave yourself. Act natural and there won't be any trouble. I like quiet women. Stay that way. - There's a gas station ahead. Better fill up before dark. - You can do better than that. - All right, look at the gas gauge. (bell dings) - What'll it be, folks? - Fill her up. - Right. Keys? - Huh? - You want the gas in the gas tank, don't you? - Could you tell me where the ladies' room is, please? - It's over there, lady. - Thank you. Excuse me. - Your wife? - Nope. - Pretty girl. - Yeah. Hey, will you check the oil and the tires, please? - Yep. I got me a pretty hot little old V8. It's a wreck but I had it modified, and she goes like a bomb. Headed through the tracks up at Dry Run. Did 103 miles an hour. What will this one do it in? I said, what will this one-- (hood slams) Been talking to myself. - Going someplace? - Well, she's all checked out and ready to go. That'll be $4. Sure a nice day to go cruising around. Weather's like this tomorrow, I'm gonna take my old wreck and go for a spin. - You interested in racing? - Well, I just fool around. Got my old wreck to the point where she'll go from zero to 50 in just 12 seconds. What will this one do it in? (engine roaring) (tires screeching) She does. But he don't seem like the Jag type. (siren blaring) (tires screeching) - We got the call only a few miles from here. - What took you so long? - He's still alive. You better call an ambulance. Did you see it? - I was right here when he shot him. - There's no gun wound. - Well, it must have been Frank Webster. - How do you know? - Well, I was the one that recognized him. I told this fella here that's who he was, and then that girl that-- - A girl with Webster? - Well, she must have been. She sent me out to the back room and when I came back, he was lying there. - Then you didn't see it. - Well, I practically did. - This is Samuels. I'm at the Saddle Peak Lodge Cafe. Yeah, that's right. Gonna need an ambulance out here. Not determined yet. That's right. Right. - What was the girl like? - Oh, kinda, you know, the kind of girl you'd see with a guy like that. - Did you know what kind of car they were driving? - A jalopy. - Did you see it? Can you describe it? - No, I didn't. But that's what he called it, the one they shot. He called her car a jalopy. - You better broadcast what you can figure out. - Young man, a woman, old car. - Yeah. Get roadblocks set up. I wonder if you could come down to headquarters. - Sure. - Good. - I'd love to get out of this death trap. Funny thing, here I am talking to a guy who turns out to be Frank Webster. And then this dame comes in and orders pineapple juice. And I was telling her, a lady just ain't safe on the streets these days. Do you want a cup of coffee? - Huh-uh. - Then I find him on the floor. I better put some lipstick on. They might want to take my picture, huh? And then I noticed this other guy wasn't a bit interested in the case, so I told the girl, I says, look. - I'd appreciate you returning my car and my freedom. - You said that before. - I'm running out of variations. I'm also running out of patience. - Any idea what to do about it? - Several ideas. None of which I intend to discuss with you. - I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble. - Oh, don't let it bother you. I guess I should be grateful you haven't murdered me yet. - Don't tempt me. - What do you expect to get out of all this? - You and this fancy car are my passport out of this country. I expect to get a few more years to live. - And I'd suppose you'd do anything to get there. - Just about. Don't try that again. I don't want to see you hurt. - Why not? -",

(coyote howling) (engine rumbling) Don't you know coyotes were afraid of humans? - Start all your cars this way? - Only the ones I steal. What's that? - An extra key. - Why didn't you tell me you had it? - Why didn't you ask me? - I don't think you can get much out of him, Sergeant, but you can try. - Critical? - It's difficult to say. Must have hit his head pretty hard. - Mr. Nielson, can you hear me? I'm a policeman. Can you give me any information? Can you hear me? - Why don't you try telling him what you think happened? He may respond to that. - You were in a fight, Nielson. A man and a woman were there. Do you know who they were? Do you know what kind of car they were driving? Can you tell us? Were they driving an old car? Do you know the man who hit you? Couldn't it have been Frank Webster? He's trying to speak. - He slipped off again. Nurse? Call me if anything develops. These concussions are pretty tricky things, Sergeant. - This isn't necessary. - Of course not. - I said I was sorry. - You're about the sorriest creature I've ever known. (tense instrumental music) - Please leave me alone. - I intend to. - You're-- you're not gonna sleep like this. - Would you rather change sides? - Please untie me. - I like to have you close. Don't worry. I've known things to go along like this for years. And then get worse. - I don't know who you think you're lookin' for. - Well, it could have been Webster. - But I thought you said it was some fancy kind of car. - He could have changed cars. (groans) - This country reminds me of the time I was bitten by a rattlesnake. Only 5 years old. Me, not the snake. The snake died. - It figures. - What's the matter? Did you get up on the wrong side of the car? - I don't like this belt around my wrists. - It suits you. All the comforts of home. Go wash your face. -",

Police have broadcast the description of Frank Webster, still reported at large. In a wild race through the Coachella Valley, Webster forced another truck into a ditch. The truck overturned and killed the driver. Webster was arrested, but escaped from jail. Now a general alarm is out for this dangerous criminal, and police through the southern half of the state are combing the area all the way to the border. It is reported Webster is accompanied by a young woman, but nothing is known of her. - They make you sound so exciting. Not at all like you. (tires screeching) - Hey, you stop more than you ride. - Well, whoever they were, they must have gone on through to the highway. - Uh, maybe. Doesn't hurt just to keep trying, though. I wish I'd taken a better look at them last night. - Oh, let's take a break. Once over this road is enough for me. (tense instrumental music) - We'll coast around the cops. Come on. - I'm hungry. I'm still hungry. - So am I. - The welcoming committee. - They sure get up early. - You know, for some reason, I'm going to miss you. - Thanks. Maybe you won't get a chance.

And if you are, when this is all over, you'll still be alive. And beautiful. - You'll never get away with it. - Maybe not. But I'm gonna try. Viva Mexico. Remember what I told you. Don't try anything. - You with the others? - Yeah. - Where you going? - Mexico. - This your, uh, wife, Mr...? - Myers, Bill Myers. What's the trouble, officer? - Looking. - So Mr. Myers and his wife are going to Mexico. Where do they start from? How do they get there, hmm, Mr. Myers? Uh, are you going to ride with me in The International tomorrow? - You're so right. - Oh. - Tell the sergeant he's coming around. And tell him to hurry. Mr. Nielson? Mr. Nielson? - How is he? - Better make it fast. - I'm a policeman. I'm trying to help you. Try to understand-- a man and a woman were in the cafe. A man attacked you. Do you know what they were driving? Can you remember? - Jag, Jag. - Yes, go on. - He's unconscious again. - Jag. What do you suppose he means by that? - Think the waitress could shed any light on it? - No, no, she couldn't. Jag. Jag. Jaguar. Jaguar, it's a racing car. The waitress said it was a jalopy. Anyway, at this point, we've got to try anything. But tomorrow, most of those cars will be at The International fenced into a five-acre park. - Well, now that we're in the park, we could stop and have lunch. Or is that impossible? - It is. - Maybe you'd rather register for the race. Or is that impossible, too? - Register? Look, Connie, will you give me a break? - Why should I? You drive people off roads, leave injured men unconscious. - Maybe someday I can explain. All right, don't give me a break. Just remember, I've got a gun and I know how to use it. - Checkpoint number one. Checkpoint number one. Number 54, JL Clancy, approaching fast. Get that truck off the course. Let Clancy pass.

The way you drive, you didn't run that truck off the road by accident. - I thought you already decided that. Would you like to win the race? - I always like to win. - I don't think I can make it. - I don't think you will. - Thanks. - What? - I said thanks! - You're welcome! - Okay, Myers, you can double back to your qualifying run now. - This is going to be a crowded one. - Yeah. - Mr. Hillman? - Yes, what can I do for you? - Officer Faraday of the state police. Wonder if I could check over your list of entrants. - Why, yeah, sure, but why? - We're looking for someone who might be hiding out in the park. We think he's driving a Jaguar. - Well, that's a new one. - It sure is. - Well, I'll do anything I can to cooperate. - You've checked all the identifications of the entrants? - Oh, yes, they'll cross the border, you know. - We don't expect to see him in the race, but we have to take every precaution. - Well, go right ahead, officer. Okay, Myers, this is your qualifying. Let her go. (suspenseful instrumental music) - Post 12, that truck! Post 12, that truck! (tires screeching) All right, you guys in the trucks, that was close, but now maybe you know what I've been talking about. Nice driving, Myers. - You and trucks just don't seem to get along. - You can say that again. How are we doing? - Don't lose speed. - I won't. - Agh! Oh, wow! (laughs) - Looks like the little lady sure approves of her driver there. Okay, 55. Myers, 55. You've qualified. Second fastest time so far. That will put you second to last at the starting line. - Second to last. - I sure get the breaks. - I feel almost as sorry for you as you do. - You're a real fighter, aren't you? - And you're a criminal wanted for murder. - Yeah. And now you can add kidnapping. We're getting out of this little playground. - Did you find anything to help you out? - No, thanks. I'll just hang around and keep my eyes open. - This can't be a roadblock. - Oh, but it is. - You'd think I was Dillinger. - Does all this attention make you feel important? - Not very. You didn't get word to them. - I wish I had. - I'll bet you do. You're lovely, all the way. Hi! What's going on down there? - Oh, the cops, they're looking for a guy that they think is here in the park. - This should be a crazy place to hide. - Well, you never know what they're gonna pull next. They figure he's gonna be driving a Jaguar. - What makes them think that? - Some fellow broke out of jail with a murder rap. They don't expect him to be racing, but with that kind of a car, he'd hang around here until the heat's off. - I doubt it. - Uh, you folks racing? - Wouldn't miss it. - Hey, that's a nice-looking Jag you got there. They're, uh, looking for him to have a young woman with him. - Come on, Bill. If you're going to get any rest, we better go. - Say, the fella they're looking for is Frank Webster, in case you run into him. Good luck in the race. - Thanks. - Oh, let's take a break. - Why here? - Nobody ever comes here. There's an old house up the road. It's been abandoned for years. (gentle instrumental music) - Thanks again. - I discovered this place when I first started coming down to the races. I've sort of considered it mine ever since. Won't you come into my parlor? - What's the pitch? - Nothing. I'm just tired. So are you. Besides, you said something about an explanation, and I'd like to hear it. - On the level? - Well, at the moment, the only thing I have against you is I never got that egg salad sandwich. - Suppose the starter's accusing his wife of not packing a lunch. - Frank! - You run away? - Later. (giggles) (gentle instrumental music) - Maybe we can mail it to him. - Nice hideout, huh? - Couldn't be better. - You know, I've never seen anyone else here. - Good spot. - No cops, no robbers, no people. When are you going to give yourself up, Frank? - I'm not going to. - You've got to face that jury sometime. - If you've got some romantic idea that I'm gonna give myself up and face a jury that's stacked against me, you can forget it. - What makes you so sure the jury's going to be against you? - Connie, look, you're a smart girl. You know a lot about Jaguars, but don't tell me about a fix in a small town when it's mad or a card game when you haven't got any cards. - Look, Frank, the whole world isn't against you. You'll get an even break if you give it a chance. - Sure, give it a chance. Listen, Connie, all my life I've been trying to get by on my own because that's the way I figured it. After the army, I saved some money, so I bought myself a truck. Not two trucks or a fleet. No partners, just me. Turned out, I was bothering somebody. Guy who owned a lot of trucks. He tried everything. Undercut me, everything. But I figured I had my rights, so I stuck. Then one of his drivers tried to run me off the road. All I was trying to do was keep from getting killed. And his truck went over the side. - Then how can they accuse you of murder? - Two minutes later, one of his other drivers was there, yelling his head off about how I drove his buddy over the cliff. He didn't even seem to care much that he was dead. - Why did you break out of jail? No jury in the world would convict you if you told them what happened. - If I got to a jury. Those truckers were coming to get me. They weren't waiting for a trial. I had to break out of jail. - That gang of hoodlums probably slept it off the next morning. If you go back now, they won't have anything to do with it. - They've got everything to do with it. - You can't prove you're innocent running away. - I can't prove it dead. - Look, I'll tell them what happened at the cafe. We'll get lawyers. You've got to believe in yourself. In the law. In someone. - Sure. Sure, Connie. Frank. - How do? - Good afternoon. - Is that your car? - Yeah. - Well, you ain't supposed to be here, you know. - No. No, I didn't know. - Are you folks from the races? Sure would like to see them. Boy, that's a good-looking car. Luckily, I came by. You know, after sunset, the cops patrol the park. And they arrest you and pinch you. - Cops would come here? - Yeah, looking for the kids, you know. Kind of, uh, a Lovers' Lane. (chuckles) Well, good evening. - Frank, I didn't know. - You're smart, like I said, Connie, but not smart enough. - Frank, I swear. - Got any more hideouts, cute spots, picnic spots nobody knows about? Trust somebody. You see why I don't? - Well, what do you expect? You hate the world and the world hates you. And that specifically and especially includes me. Oh! Let go of my arm. - I'll break it for you if you try any more tricks! - Faber! Hey, Faber! - Sit down! -",

Don't try anything. - Hi there. - Hi. - Where have you two been hiding out? Say, this isn't a big romance, is it? - Of course not. - What time does the antique race start? - We ought to make it just about now. Connie, I'll let you ride with me. - No, thanks. We'll meet you there. - Okay, don't run away again. - And in this opening race, we have everything but the Stanley Steamer. Oh, oh, I take it all back. Wait a minute. Here is the Stanley Steamer, ready to defend its honor against the Model T.  Wait a minute.  Here comes Dennis Maxwell.  Well, folks, you can see for yourselves, the race is about to begin. - Not everybody can get in the marshal stand. - Looks like everybody has. - Tell me, where have you two been all afternoon? - Oh, we just picked up a bite of lunch. - When are you gonna get your pit check? - Huh? - I said when are you going to get your pit check? - You made your point. Why didn't you tell him? - Isn't it exciting? Oh, we're going to get checked over and gassed up in the morning. - Say, Mr. Myers, how'd you and Connie ever meet each other? - Oh, look. - And now we have the announcement of the winner in this, the last race. Mr. AJ Jones driving his Maxwell. - How about something to eat? - Fine. - Would you like to join us, Mr. Myers? - Yeah, thanks. -"

As the cars go into the straightaway, Daniels is holding the lead, but Nagel is moving up to challenge Robinson for second. All moving down the course, individual duels are shaping up. Trading the field are the two fastest qualifiers-- Bill Myers in 55 who's driving cautiously, but he's being pushed by Faber Hatfield, who's driving that very hot 17c and wants to make a real race of it. It's Nagel off and running very fast, but he's planning out of the turn and takes the escape path. He's turning around now and coming back onto the track. He'll have trouble getting their lead back again. Bill Myers and Faber Hatfield are still fighting it out, with Hatfield pressing Myers all the way, almost forcing him to stay in there. He's crowding Myers into the turn, and Myers can't make it. He's out on the escape route, but swinging around and back up the course, picking up speed. He was driving cautiously up to this, but now he's really moving. Maybe he wants to pay Hatfield back for that crowding on the turn. But he'll have to catch him first. Entering turn number seven, he's moving into the lead. Jensen second in 59, spins out, but he's all right. It's a very sharp turn, and the boys are taking it fast. Hatfield is still moving up on Myers, who's trying to get back up there with him. Gordon leads pack into turn number seven, where Jensen spun out. (tires skidding) Myers is back in the race and now pressing Hatfield. Myers passes! As they approach the last turn onto the park, it's Tupper holding the lead with Daniels pressing close behind. Myers and Hatfield are in a challenging position for the lead, and they swing out of the park and into the mountains on the way to Mexico. For further progress on this great race, The International, listen to the bulletins on your radio. - All right, there's the phone, but I don't see what good it's gonna do you. The race has already started. - Operator? Give me the police. Police? Listen very carefully. The driver of car 55 in The International is Frank Webster. Just try to stop him at the border. He's innocent. Thanks for the lift. - Well, it looks like it's okay now, Eddie. - Yeah, she's all ready. - Harrison. - Connie, how are you? - Harrison, can I use your-- - Too bad you can't drive in the race. Connie, what's the matter? - Why aren't you racing? - Something happened to the starter, but-- - Is it all right now? - Yeah, sure, but-- - Could I use your car? - Connie, it's too late to drive in the race. - I've got to get to the border. I'll use the main highway. - Say, what is this? - I'll explain it later. It's important to me, Harrison, please. - Hey, Eddie, is she ready to go now? -",

Trading the field are the two fastest qualifiers-- Bill Myers in 55 who's driving cautiously, but he's being pushed by Faber Hatfield, who's driving that very hot 17c and wants to make a real race of it. It's Nagel off and running very fast, but he's planning out of the turn and takes the escape path. He's turning around now and coming back onto the track. He'll have trouble getting their lead back again. Bill Myers and Faber Hatfield are still fighting it out, with Hatfield pressing Myers all the way, almost forcing him to stay in there. He's crowding Myers into the turn, and Myers can't make it. He's out on the escape route, but swinging around and back up the course, picking up speed. He was driving cautiously up to this, but now he's really moving. Maybe he wants to pay Hatfield back for that crowding on the turn. But he'll have to catch him first. Entering turn number seven, he's moving into the lead. Jensen second in 59, spins out, but he's all right. It's a very sharp turn, and the boys are taking it fast. Hatfield is still moving up on Myers, who's trying to get back up there with him. Gordon leads pack into turn number seven, where Jensen spun out.  Myers is back in the race and now pressing Hatfield. Myers passes! As they approach the last turn onto the park, it's Tupper holding the lead with Daniels pressing close behind. Myers and Hatfield are in a challenging position for the lead, and they swing out of the park and into the mountains on the way to Mexico. For further progress on this great race, The International, listen to the bulletins on your radio. - All right, there's the phone, but I don't see what good it's gonna do you. The race has already started. - Operator? Give me the police. Police? Listen very carefully. The driver of car 55 in The International is Frank Webster. Just try to stop him at the border. He's innocent. Thanks for the lift. - Well, it looks like it's okay now, Eddie. - Yeah, she's all ready. - Harrison. - Connie, how are you? - Harrison, can I use your-- - Too bad you can't drive in the race. Connie, what's the matter? - Why aren't you racing? - Something happened to the starter, but-- - Is it all right now? - Yeah, sure, but-- - Could I use your car? - Connie, it's too late to drive in the race. - I've got to get to the border. I'll use the main highway. - Say, what is this? - I'll explain it later. It's important to me, Harrison, please. - Hey, Eddie, is she ready to go now? -"
