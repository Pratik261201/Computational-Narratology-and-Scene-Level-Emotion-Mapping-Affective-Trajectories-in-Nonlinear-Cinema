But if I can somehow go back to the beginning of all of this, I might be able to save her.\" Evan! We're gonna be late again. When did you ever care about getting to school on time? We're putting up pictures for parents' night. Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time. Is dad gonna come? You know the answer to that. Can't he just come out for one day? We've been over this 100 times. It's too dangerous for him. But Lenny said his dad's coming, and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad-- Okay, I get the point. But I'm not so bad, am I? No. Okay, have a great day. I love you. I'll pick you up later. Gotta go. Bye. Bye! Mrs. Treborn, I need to speak with you. Can it wait till tonight? I'm already late for work and I-- I think you really need to see this. Tommy, leave Lenny alone. Don't make me send you to Mr. Voytek's office. I was gonna show this to the principal, - but I thought I should talk to you first. - What is it? Yesterday I had all the children make drawings of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did. But this... I don't understand. Evan did this? - Can I keep this drawing? - Oh, of course. Um, there is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn, - I feel bad even mentioning. - What? When I asked Evan about the drawing, well, he couldn't remember doing it. I don't wanna go. I don't like this place, mom. I think it's creepy. I promise I won't make any bad pictures. You're gonna be fine, okay? He just wants to do a couple tests, that's all. - Oh. - You'll like him. Just tell me he hasn't inherited his father's illness. I'm sure the test results will come back negative. But there's something else you can do to monitor his memory. - Anything. - A journal. Just have him write down everything that he does. - And what will that do? - It could help jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. These test results will come back in a few days - and we'll take it from there. - Okay. \"Today mommy is taking me to play with Kayleigh and Tommy. I will meet their father and see what a real dad is like.\" Great, see you soon. Evan-- Evan, what are you doing with that knife? What happened?",

Kayleigh... what happened? The good news is the results are negative. I found no evidence of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors. But you must have something you can go on. If I was to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related. But he's seven years old. What kind of stress can a seven-year-old have? Plenty. Maybe he has severe coping problems about not having a father. You said the last time the blackouts occurred, he was visiting his friend's dad. Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father and I've been putting it off. It's worth a shot, Andrea. We can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, Evan comes in for a quick visit, and with a little luck, no more missing father complex. \"April 15th. Today I get to meet my father. His name is Jason and he's crazy. I hope he lets me call him dad.\" You mean dad lives here? Not in this wing, actually, no. Now if your dad seems a little sleepy, it's because of the medicine, okay? Okay. It'll just be a moment, okay? It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right? Uh-huh. Mom says I have your smile and your hair. Nooo! No! It's gonna be okay.

Are you hurting her? No, I'm protecting her. Okay. Now let's move forward in time. What do you see? I see a car. Yes, Evan, tell me about the car. Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, it's only a movie. You are completely safe. I can't-- The car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods. The car doesn't vanish, Evan. The movie in your head is broken, that's all. Now tell me about the car. I can't! It's coming-- Fight it, Evan, hurry. It's coming! - Oh my God! - On the count of 10, - You're going to wake up feeling refreshed... - What are you doing? ...and remembering everything that we talked about. - What is happening to him? Make it stop! - One, you're feeling awake. - Two, your eyes are not feeling as heavy. Five, six. - Wake up! - Come on, Evan, wake up! Nine, 10. - Wake up! Oh God. What happened? Did it work? All right, thanks, mom. See you later. Wipe that sad-ass look off your face before you get us busted. Did you see the way Evan's mom was looking at you? Sorry. All right, will someone tell me already what the hell happened with the mailbox? Don't you ever bring that shit up again. Not ever! Let's go. Are you okay? Holy shit! Look at that fat fuck! He's got bigger titties than Lenny's mom. - Shhh! - Shut up, faggot. No one's talking to you. I'm sorry, Kayleigh, this was a bad idea. You really don't remember anything that happened? You're so lucky. Look, everything's gonna be okay. Lenny'll be fine. You'll see. Sorry. It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny. Your dad did that? I deserve a lot worse. What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better father and brother. All they do is make you feel like shit. You really have no clue how beautiful you are, do you? What the fuck are you doing?! Buying popcorn. What the fuck are doing? - Whoops. - I can't believe you freaking did that. He's a little punk. I can't believe what you just did. Stop it! Stop hitting him. What's wrong with you? Stop it! Somebody, please help us. Okay, that's it, kid. You're out of here. Get him away! Get him away!

        "Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand? Yes. Where are you now? I'm standing next to Kayleigh. My hands are over her ears. Are you hurting her? No, I'm protecting her. Okay. Now let's move forward in time. What do you see? I see a car. Yes, Evan, tell me about the car. Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, it's only a movie. You are completely safe. I can't-- The car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods. The car doesn't vanish, Evan. The movie in your head is broken, that's all. Now tell me about the car. I can't! It's coming-- Fight it, Evan, hurry. It's coming! - Oh my God! - On the count of 10, - You're going to wake up feeling refreshed... - What are you doing? ...and remembering everything that we talked about. - What is happening to him? Make it stop! - One, you're feeling awake. - Two, your eyes are not feeling as heavy. Five, six. - Wake up! - Come on, Evan, wake up! Nine, 10. - Wake up! Oh God. What happened? Did it work? All right, thanks, mom. See you later. Wipe that sad-ass look off your face before you get us busted. Did you see the way Evan's mom was looking at you? Sorry. All right, will someone tell me already what the hell happened with the mailbox? Don't you ever bring that shit up again. Not ever! Let's go. Are you okay? Holy shit! Look at that fat fuck! He's got bigger titties than Lenny's mom. - Shhh! - Shut up, faggot. No one's talking to you. I'm sorry, Kayleigh, this was a bad idea. You really don't remember anything that happened? You're so lucky. Look, everything's gonna be okay. Lenny'll be fine. You'll see. Sorry. It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny. Your dad did that? I deserve a lot worse. What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better father and brother. All they do is make you feel like shit. You really have no clue how beautiful you are, do you? What the fuck are you doing?! Buying popcorn. What the fuck are doing? - Whoops. - I can't believe you freaking did that. He's a little punk. I can't believe what you just did. Stop it! Stop hitting him. What's wrong with you? Stop it! Somebody, please help us. Okay, that's it, kid. You're out of here. Get him away! Get him away! Now in another story, the peaceful town of Briarville was rocked this afternoon in the wake of a horrible act of vandalism."

Oh my God! Evan! Evan! Evan! Hey, where you going? You ever notice Kayleigh's smile? I love her smile. Lenny's the best. You guys make a great couple. You ever think that I'll find someone? Evan! - Where are we going? - We're taking you to the hospital, Evan. - No, take me back. - Sorry, your mom would kill me. - Oh. - You take me back, Lenny! You owe me that much. What are you geeks looking at? It must be nice to be so goddamed perfect, huh? Fucking losers! Lenny, help me! Here, get him over. Get him over. Hey, Brian, how's your head feeling, buddy? I saw that girl you went home with. Did she borrow your razor this morning? You're so bad. Hey, there's Tommy. Hey, Tommy!"
