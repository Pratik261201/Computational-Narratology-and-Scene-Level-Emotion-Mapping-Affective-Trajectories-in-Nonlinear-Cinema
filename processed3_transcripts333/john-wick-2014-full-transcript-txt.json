City crews still working this morning. They're trying to restore power Good news is, today should be sunny with highs in the low 60s. Relentless weather these past few weeks. So get out there, enjoy the sun, go to the park, get outside if you can, because it's not gonna last long. What are you doing, John? Looking at you. Come here. Are you still filming? Just an anniversary... It's been a while. My condolences. How're you holdin' up? I keep asking \"Why her?\" There's no rhyme or reason to this life. It's days like today scattered among the rest. Are you sure? Don't blame yourself. What are you really doing here, Marcus? Just checkin' up on an old friend. Goodbye, John. John Wick? Yes. Sign here, please. And the pen. Sorry. Here you go. Good night. Thanks. \"John, I'm sorry I can't be there for you. \"But you still need something, someone, to love. \"So start with this. Because the car doesn't count. \"I love you, John. \"This illness has loomed over us for a long time, \"and now that I have found my peace, find yours. \"Until that day, your best friend, Helen.\" Hey. Hey. Daisy. Of course. Hey. Come on. I'm up. I'm up... I'm up. I'm up. Hey! Oh. Right. What? We'll grab you some kibble later. Nice ride. Mustang. Boss 429. She a '70? '69. Huh. Beautiful car. Thanks. How much? Excuse me? How much for the car? She's not for sale. Oh, I love dogs. You have good day, sir. All right, come on, then. How you doin'? You need to go? Uh-huh. Yo, Aurelio! Ah? I want a new VIN number and some clean papers. Where'd you get that car? Is it here? It was. I asked you where the hell did you get it? Iosef Tarasov nicked it. Viggo's son. Yeah. All right, get out of here. Just get out of my shop. Get out right now. Did you just lose your shit, Aurelio? Because we own you. What did you say? What did you say to me? We own you. You don't own me, punk. I work with your father, all right? The owner of that car, did you kill him or what? No. I sure as hell fucked up his dog. You fucked up his dog? That's what you did? You fucked up his dog? Yeah... That's crazy shit, man. Aw, look at you. That's great. You're gonna come into my shop and you're gonna pull a gun on me.",

I'll tell you somethin' he's gonna understand. You've got a fuckin' pair on you, old man! I guess we'll be takin' our business someplace else. So what are you gonna do? I need a ride. Aurelio speaking. I heard you struck my son. Yes sir, I did. And may I ask why? Yeah. Well, because he stole John Wick's car, sir. And, uh, killed his dog. Oh. Viggo? Yeah? They've agreed to your terms. I mean, it's not like you gave them much of a choice anyway, though, right? Congratulations. Sir? Have you seen my son? How was your trip, kid? We won't be hearing from them anytime soon. Or ever. That's a nice jacket. Thanks. Yeah. Should I go? Viggo, English, please. Come on... Stay, God damn it! What did I do? We did what you asked. No one saw shit. I'm not talking about Atlantic City. What, then? You mean Aurelio's? So I stole a fucking car! Aw, fuck, Viggo! Right, I'll go... You stay! It's not what you did, son, that angers me so. It's who you did it to. Who? The fucking nobody! That fuckin' nobody is John Wick. He once was an associate of ours. They call him Baba Yaga. The Boogeyman? Well, John wasn't exactly The Boogeyman. He was the one you sent to kill the fucking Boogeyman. Oh. John is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will. Something you know very little about. I once saw him kill three men in a bar. With a pencil. With a fuckin'... ...pencil. Then suddenly one day he asked to leave. It's over a woman, of course. So I made a deal with him. I gave him an impossible task. A job no one could have pulled off. The bodies he buried that day laid the foundation of what we are now. And then, my son, a few days after his wife died, you steal his car and kill his fuckin' dog. Father, I can make this right. Oh... How do you plan that? By finishing what I started. What the... Did he hear a fucking word I said? Iosef! Iosef! Listen! Huh? John will come for you. And you will do nothing, because you can do nothing. So get the fuck out of my sight! Hello, John. I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry. My condolences. It seems to be fate, or happenstance or just bad fuckin' luck caused our paths to cross once again.",

This is Wick. Yes, John Wick, that's right. I'd like to make a dinner reservation for 12. Good to see you, John. Charlie. You look good. And here I'd feared you'd left all this behind. Will I be hearin' from you anytime soon? Goodbye, Charlie. John. Of course he did. Put a contract on John Wick. How much? Two million. English, Viggo, please. Put Iosef in the Red Circle and wait. For what? For John Wick, of course. Thank you. To what do I owe this visit? I have a job for you. And I've got a phone. Hmm. I want to offer you this face to face seeing as how you might find it personal. Would you kill John Wick for two million dollars? After all, you were close. Is the contract exclusive? No, it's open. It's a timely matter, it has to be handled quickly. Consider it done. Thank you, Marcus. I know I can trust you. Thanks for the drink. Room 918. Do enjoy your stay. Thanks. Good seeing you again, John. Perkins. I have you for two nights. Depending on business, it may be more. Of course, sir. So when did the old place get a facelift? Around four years ago. But I assure you, sir, she really hasn't changed much. Same owner? Same owner. Room 818. And, as always, it is a pleasure having you with us again, Mr. Wick. What are you doing, John? Looking at you. Come here. Hello, Winston. Jonathan. Now, as I recall, weren't you the one tasked to dole out the beatings, not receive them? Rusty, I guess. To what do we owe the pleasure? Iosef Tarasov. What about him? I'd like to talk with him. A talk, you say. I'm familiar with the parlance, Jonathan. I want to ask you this. Have you returned to the fold? Just visiting. Have you thought this through? I mean, chewed down to the bone? You got out once. You dip so much as a pinky back into this pond, you may well find something reaches out and drags you back into its depths. Where do I find him? Hey. Wick's at The Continental. Welcome home, John.

      "raw_text": "Yeah? How brazen. If they're willing to break the rules of Continental, double the bounty. You know the rules. No business can be conducted on these premises lest incurring heavy penalties. Have a drink and relax. For now. It's personal. Holy shit! Jonathan! Hey, Addy. My God! How long has it been? Four years? Five and change. So tell me, how was life on the other side? It was good, Addy. Far better than I deserved. Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your... Thanks. I've never seen you like this. Like what? Vulnerable. I'm retired. Not if you're drinkin' here, you're not. Usual? Please. Compliments of the house. Thanks. Did you see the tits on that girl? Better hope Lita is working tonight. Are you scared of the fuckin' boogeyman? I'm not. No. But you should be. I want another bottle! Right fuckin' now! Go get me a bottle! Come on! Hello, Francis. Mr. Wick. Are you here on business, sir? Afraid so, Francis. Why don't you take the night off. Thank you, sir. Fuck you, motherfucker! Where is Iosef? Bath house, downstairs. Go! John Wick's there. Go get him! Move! He's here! He's fucking here! He's there! He's coming! Get in! Get in! Come on, come on! Good evening, Mr. Wick. Good evening. How may I be of service? Is the doctor in? Yes, sir. 24/7. Then send him up, please. Yes, sir. How good's your laundry? I'm sorry to say that no one's that good. No. I thought not. May I suggest a drink, sir. Bourbon, perhaps. That sounds perfect. So what sort of movement am I looking at? Well, if you're lookin' to heal, then keep it marginal. However, if you still have... ...business to attend to, take two of these beforehand. Your stitches'll tear and you'll bleed, but you'll have full function. Do you need anything for the pain? No, I've got that covered. Hey, John. Perkins? I thought I'd let myself in. I noticed. I never knew Ms. Perkins to get out of bed for less than three. Viggo's giving me four to break hotel rules. That's unwise, I assure you. You were always a pussy. Yes? I apologize for calling you at this hour, but we have received a number of grievances from your floor concerning the noise. My apologies. I was dealing with an uninvited guest. Have you need then of, say, a dinner reservation, perhaps? Perhaps. I'll have to get back to you. No! Where's Iosef? Fuck you. Where's Viggo?",

Have a drink and relax. For now. It's personal. Holy shit! Jonathan! Hey, Addy. My God! How long has it been? Four years? Five and change. So tell me, how was life on the other side? It was good, Addy. Far better than I deserved. Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your... Thanks. I've never seen you like this. Like what? Vulnerable. I'm retired. Not if you're drinkin' here, you're not. Usual? Please. Compliments of the house. Thanks. Did you see the tits on that girl? Better hope Lita is working tonight. Are you scared of the fuckin' boogeyman? I'm not. No. But you should be. I want another bottle! Right fuckin' now! Go get me a bottle! Come on! Hello, Francis. Mr. Wick. Are you here on business, sir? Afraid so, Francis. Why don't you take the night off. Thank you, sir. Fuck you, motherfucker! Where is Iosef? Bath house, downstairs. Go! John Wick's there. Go get him! Move! He's here! He's fucking here! He's there! He's coming! Get in! Get in! Come on, come on! Good evening, Mr. Wick. Good evening. How may I be of service? Is the doctor in? Yes, sir. 24/7. Then send him up, please. Yes, sir. How good's your laundry? I'm sorry to say that no one's that good. No. I thought not. May I suggest a drink, sir. Bourbon, perhaps. That sounds perfect. So what sort of movement am I looking at? Well, if you're lookin' to heal, then keep it marginal. However, if you still have... ...business to attend to, take two of these beforehand. Your stitches'll tear and you'll bleed, but you'll have full function. Do you need anything for the pain?
