Thank you. - Are you hungry? New Moon Cafè. - No, thank you. Best in Chinatown. A gift from Conrad Van Orton. - Interesting. - What is? Your brother was a client with our London branch. We do a sort of informal scoring. His numbers are outstanding. Really? - You sure you're not hungry? - No. Now, you need to fill out these forms. There's an application and a couple of psych tests. The MMPI and the TAT. For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like. We'll run a TRW. \"I sometimes hurt small animals. True or false?\" \"I feel guilty when I masturbate.\" (JIM CHUCKLING) Well, I don't write the questions. I just review the answers. (WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA) (SIGHING) - What is this for? - A sense of your capabilities... No, what is this for? What are you selling? Oh... - It's a game. - A game? Specifically tailored for each participant. Think of it as a great vacation. Except you don't go to it, it comes to you. What kind of vacation? - It's different every time. - Humor me with specifics. We provide whatever's lacking. - What if nothing is lacking? - May I make two suggestions? You think I'll participate without knowing... First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing. Second, you don't have to decide today. Take the silly test, fill out the forms. One day, your game begins. You either love it or hate it. Decide then. You know, we're like an experiential Book-of-the-Month Club. You can drop out at any time with no further obligation. That was my sales pitch. - How long will this take? - An hour for those, an hour for the physical. - Physical? - It's a cursory examination. Turn your head and cough. You'll be out of here in no time. (SIGHING) Confused. Risky. Bloody. Whoops. MARIA: Mr. Sutherland called. NICHOLAS: Make it Wednesday. Anson Baer called about tomorrow. Tomorrow? - How much longer will this take? - Not long, you're almost done. You said that two hours ago. Put it back until tomorrow. ELECTRONIC VOICE: ... following emotional responses. You have 0.9 seconds to enter your emotional response. Reaction time is a factor. Please make a selection for the following emotional responses.",

        "I'm sorry about all this hullabaloo here. We're... Well, we're still moving. I got an office around here somewhere. Do you mind holding that? Thank you very much. Thank you. - Are you hungry? New Moon Cafè. - No, thank you. Best in Chinatown. A gift from Conrad Van Orton. - Interesting. - What is? Your brother was a client with our London branch. We do a sort of informal scoring. His numbers are outstanding. Really? - You sure you're not hungry? - No. Now, you need to fill out these forms. There's an application and a couple of psych tests. The MMPI and the TAT. For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like. We'll run a TRW. \"I sometimes hurt small animals. True or false?\" \"I feel guilty when I masturbate.\"  Well, I don't write the questions. I just review the answers.   - What is this for? - A sense of your capabilities... No, what is this for? What are you selling? Oh... - It's a game. - A game? Specifically tailored for each participant. Think of it as a great vacation. Except you don't go to it, it comes to you. What kind of vacation? - It's different every time. - Humor me with specifics. We provide whatever's lacking. - What if nothing is lacking? - May I make two suggestions? You think I'll participate without knowing... First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing. Second, you don't have to decide today. Take the silly test, fill out the forms. One day, your game begins. You either love it or hate it. Decide then. You know, we're like an experiential Book-of-the-Month Club. You can drop out at any time with no further obligation. That was my sales pitch. - How long will this take? - An hour for those, an hour for the physical. - Physical? - It's a cursory examination. Turn your head and cough. You'll be out of here in no time.  Confused. Risky. Bloody. Whoops. MARIA: Mr. Sutherland called. NICHOLAS: Make it Wednesday. Anson Baer called about tomorrow. Tomorrow? - How much longer will this take? - Not long, you're almost done. You said that two hours ago. Put it back until tomorrow. ELECTRONIC VOICE: ... following emotional responses.

I don't think this visit comes as a surprise. - The projections were too optimistic. - Admittedly, yes. Our EPS was 150 last quarter. We are up eight cents per share. The expectations were ten. The expectations meant everything. Will you hold me to it over pennies? My stock is falling, I don't know about yours. Those pennies are costing millions. Give me next quarter. If you still feel this way, vote your shares. Today is what counts, Anson. (SIGHING) You... You intractable son of a bitch. If your father could see you now. - What? - Your father was a friend. A friend. God damn it, I watched you grow up. Because you went fishing with my father, I should watch you throw my money away? - I was... - I'm not finished. You misspoke before when you said you're stepping down. I am firing you. Action is taken, confidence is restored. - The stock goes up. - No. There's no Baer/Grant Publishing... No Baer/Grant Publishing without Anson Baer. Where's Stewart Grant? Probably out sailing, enjoying his golden years, wondering where the hell you are, Anson. I'm sorry. You failed. I have prepared a severance package that is more than equitable. Valid until this evening. I could fight you on this. If I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate. Benefits shrink, options narrow, and your compensation will be shriveled. I think it's in your best interest, Anson, to... Well, I guess this is your lucky day. My lawyers will be in touch with you. Excuse me, has Conrad Van Orton left a message? - I'll check right away, Mr. Van Orton. - Thank you. (EXCLAIMING) I'm so sorry. Here. - Please don't do that. - I'm so sorry. I wasn't even looking. - I'm really having a bad day. - How about a bad month? You did almost the same thing to me last week. - Here. - Don't do that. Just get me some napkins and some soda water. It looks like the cleaning bill's gonna be more than the suit. I don't think so. - It was an accident, sir. - Terrific. I said I was sorry. - Asshole. - Christine. - Mr. Van Orton is a valued customer. - Fine. Then you kiss his ass. - Don't you talk to me like that. - I apologized, I offered to help. - Clean out your locker. - What? You heard me.",

Listen to yourself. - You won't control this conversation. - Why would I do what you're describing? - You resent me. - Stop being emotional. - It kills you that I'm living my life. - Lower your voice! You afraid someone's gonna witness a scene? - Get back to your house! - Stop it. I'm calling the cops. You're afraid someone will see what a control freak you are. What is wrong with you? Oh, I'm sorry I didn't live up to expectations. - Oh, bullshit. - I'm not you. I don't wanna be you. - There you go again. - I'm your brother. Pushing the responsibility on me. - I'm your brother! - All I ever tried to do was help you. I don't want your help. Nobody asked you to play Dad. No! You don't say that! Did I have a choice? Did I have a choice?   Conrad!    NICHOLAS ON PHONE: All I ever tried to do was help you. CONRAD ON PHONE: Nobody asked you to play Dad. NICHOLAS ON PHONE: Did I have a choice?  Taxi! 2210 Broadway.   Hey, buddy, you missed the turn. Hey! Do you hear me? You missed the turn...  Oh, no. No. Stop the car. Stop the car!  Thank you. Open the door. Unlock the door. Open the goddamned door!  Listen, I am a very wealthy man  And whatever they're paying you, I'll double it.  Jesus...  No!  MAN: Are you out of your fucking mind? It's a game. If it's a game...  Here they are. - Detective, I'm Sam Sutherland. - Tim Foley. FOLEY: Do you know where we're going? SAM: This way. 14th floor. FOLEY: Okay, management for the building says the space hasn't been officially rented yet. The County Recorder has no listing for a Consumer Recreation Service or any derivation thereof. When the divers find the cab, they'll pull the plates. - Have you spoken to your brother? - He hasn't called me back yet. - What about the house? - The graffiti was oil-based. - Illegal in the States. - It's not impossible to trace. The photo, the gun, the clown, the ambulance, it's all pending. Breaking and entering, we got solid. Malicious mischief, vandalism and harassment. Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment... Attempted murder."
