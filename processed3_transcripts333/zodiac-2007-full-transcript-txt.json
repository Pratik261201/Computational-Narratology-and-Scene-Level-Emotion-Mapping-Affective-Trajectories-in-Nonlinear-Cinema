No, it's not him. lt's the voice. The voice is too high. lt's too young. All right. Thanks for coming down, Bryan. Do you have blackouts? That's okay. l got it. They pulled off the trace. Our Daly City no-show called from a mental institution. Oakland PD's operator is sure the man she talked to had a deeper voice. Calmer. Might have actually been him. CHARLES: \"So l shall change my way of collecting slaves. \"l shall no longer announce to anyone when l commit my murders. \"They shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger \"and a few fake accidents, et cetera. \"The police shall never catch me \"because l have been too clever for them. \"l look like the description passed out only when l do my thing. \"The rest of the time l look entirely different. \"l shall not tell you what my disguise consists ofwhen l kill. \"As ofyet l have left no fingerprints behind me, \"contrary to what the police say. \"l wear transparent fingertips. \"All it is is two coats of airplane cement coated on my fingertips. \"l enjoy needling the blue pigs. Hey, blue pig, l was in the park. \"You were using fire trucks to mask the sound ofyour cruising prowl cars. \"Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up \"to have your nose rubbed in your booboos? \"lfyou cops think l am going to take on a bus the way l stated l was, \"you deserve to have holes in your heads.\"  And you need to look at this.  \"Take one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, \"one gallon of stove oil, \"and dump a few bags of gravel on top...\" -Okay. -lt's a bomb. Okay. We gotta call the Army and see if this science experiment could actually work. ARMSTRONG: Another cipher. -When did these arrive? -They arrived this morning. TOSCHl: Are you planning to publish?  Robert. We should have a drink.  Thank you. So, tell me about yourself. -You married? -Divorced."

The letters are a little too neat for someone to have written with the wrong hand. But not for Leigh, right. -What do you mean? -He's ambidextrous. He can write with either hand. Didn't you guys know that? ln everyday life, Allen uses his left hand. Job applications, letters to friends, et cetera. But he writes the Zodiac letters with his right hand producing a different handwriting that he can't be linked to. We got to see this guy, Chief. -Where is he? -ARMSTRONG: Vallejo. He works at Union Oil in Pinole. His brother's up there, too. See them both. Make sure you call Mulanax. lt is his backyard. Oh, right, because that worked so well for us in Riverside. Cooperation, that's us, at all costs. FOREMAN: You can talk to him in here. Coke machine's busted, by the way. l'll go get him for you. So how do you guys wanna do this? Well, Bill talked to the informants. He leads, we follow? lt's okay by me.  Mr. Allen, l'm lnspector Bill Armstrong. This is lnspector Dave Toschi and Sergeant Jack Mulanax. We're investigating the Zodiac murders in San Francisco and Vallejo. Please, sit down. ARMSTRONG: The informant notified us that you made certain statements 1 1 months prior to the first Zodiac murder. lf they're true, they're quite incriminating. Do you recall having any such conversation? -No. -Have you ever read or heard anything about the Zodiac?"

They started around 1 :30 a.m., and this was before anyone in the family knew that Darlene had been shot. -This was in the Vallejo files? -Yeah. God damn it. lt's got to be more than just a coincidence, right? l mean, somebody doesn'tjust randomly prank phone call a victim's entire family 90 minutes after they were shot."

The military boot prints. The same size shoes and gloves. The Most Dangerous Game. The Zodiac watch. The background with school children. The misspellings of Christ-mass. The bloody knives. All circumstantial. Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys. We should have found one of those things in that trailer. -We didn't. -That's... Okay. Catherine Allen states that \"Leigh cleaned out his trailer on Friday afterwork \"and moved it to Santa Rosa on Saturday, August 7th, 1971 .\" You interviewed him at the refinery on August 4th. -Yeah. -So, he's cleaning out his trailer, he's moving into a different county 48 hours after you interviewed him? Okay. Okay. Look at the stuff side by side, Dave. All right. Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen and the Zodiac, their timelines. -When was the first murder in Vallejo? -Christmas, 1968. Eight months before that, Allen is fired for molesting his students and his family discovers that he's a pedophile. -Now, when do the letters begin? -July, '69. After the murder of Darlene Ferrin. And they continue until you go to see him at work. Now, after that, do any of the letters contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?"
