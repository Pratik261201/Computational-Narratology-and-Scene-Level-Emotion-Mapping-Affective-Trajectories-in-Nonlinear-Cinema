      "raw_text": "Hello, moviegoers. This is Mr. Jag... speaking to you for Dreamland Studios. This beautiful mobile home you see before you... is the current hideout of the notorious beauty Divine... the filthiest person alive. Because of this cover story... in one of your sleazier national tabloids... she has been forced to go underground... disguising her appearance... and adopting the alias of Babs Johnson. With her live her trusted traveling companion Cotton... her delinquent son Crackers... and her mentally ill mother Miss Edie. Let's take a peek inside. It's 10:30. Babs, Babs. Why isn't the eggman here? I'm starving to death for some eggs. Please, Babs, come in and give me some eggs. I'm coming, Mama. I'm coming. You can hold on. Cotton, Cotton. Babs won't give me my eggs. Cotton, please come in here and give me my eggs. Be in in a minute, Edie. Don't you worry. l'll fry you up some, honey. Eggs! Good morning, Mama. I bet you're hungry. Oh, Babs, I'm starving to death. Hasn't that eggman come yet? I love that eggman so much. No, he hasn't come yet, Mama, but we still have some eggs. l'll put some on for you. Did you sleep well? Oh, Babs, I slept so well. Where did you get this train? Did you sleep in the caboose last night? How did you know I love trains? It's not a train, Mama. It's our new mobile home, and I sleep in the other room. We all have our own rooms this time... me, you, and Cotton. And Crackers has that nice little shed right out back... so he can have his friends in whenever he likes... without waking us up. lsn't it wonderful? Now, you just sit tight... and l'll fry you up Over light today, Mama? Oh, no, Babs, no. It's sunny out today. I want them sunny-side up. You know how I like them, Babs. I know how you like them, Mama. l'll be right back. Across town, located in the teeming metropolis... known as downtown Baltimore... live Connie and Raymond Marble, two jealous perverts... that hate Divine's fame and notoriety... more than anything in the whole world. For Connie and Raymond Marble, it was the beginning of the end. Well, Miss Sandstone... after looking over your qualifications... my husband and I have decided that you're not exactly... what we had in mind for the job. Not only have you never heard of Divine... which is one of the key elements...",

I'm going to bring her back real soon... for you all to enjoy. What do you mean, Humpty Dumpty was an egg? How could a person be an egg, Cotton? How could a person be an egg? Well, he had little legs and little arms... and he could walk and talk and all... just like a person. Only he was an egg-- a little egg, all dressed up. Tell it to me again, Cotton. You should be learning it by now, Edie. Now, listen carefully. Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the king's horses and all the king's men... couldn't put Humpty together again. Do you get it, Edie? Do you understand? Tell me some more egg stories, Cotton. Please tell me some more stories. I'm on my way. You sure are dressed up, Babs. You look real pretty. Oh, thank you, Cotton. Why, a girl can never tell... who she might run into when she's downtown. Why, I'm all dressed up and ready to fall in love. I kind of wish I was going out, too... but I think Crackers... is bringing his lady friend out here... and I don't want to miss that. It's usually a pretty good show. Oh, I know. You can go into town the next time I go. It's just those errands I have to run. Besides, you and Crackers will have... a pretty good time right here. That little shed's just perfect. I know it, Babs. lt'll be the first time we've had anyone out here... and I can't wait to see how it works. I hope she doesn't give us any trouble. Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. Crackers has a pretty good eye for what he likes. Just say a little prayer that I find a little something. Why, I haven't fallen in love for three whole days. I'm just itching to find somebody... with a little imagination. Bye-bye, Babs. Mother, you do not have to raise your voice... and you don't have to yell. We're all right here. We can all hear you. I do have to yell. I'm starving to death... and that eggman ain't going to come... and I know it. You know he never comes until later, Mother. She'll be all right.",

Mr. Marble and l that you will get Noodles... but, first, have a seat... so I can just briefly recheck your application. Don't say anything, all right? Just don't say a word. When are you going to get her out of here? Come on, little Noodles, you just found a new home. That's real nice! Poor fucking Alice dies giving birth... you can't even bother to move the body... and now the bitch has sold the kid! Poor baby! And you, you little suckling... can't even get me my tranquilizers! You shithead, where are my pills? That bitch can afford it. She's got another couple grand coming for this one. Can't she at least give me my fucking pills? I said don't talk to me when I come down here. I don't give a fuck what you said, you fucking pig! Get this body out of here! It's making me sick! When are they gonna get another one?

Just hope she likes to experiment... you know what I mean? A little sweet talking goes a long, long way. Give me your hand, honey. Channing! Jesus Christ. Are they here yet? Yes, they've been waiting. Well, show them in. Mrs. Marble will see you now. Come on, Merle, she's ready to see us. I'm coming, I'm coming. Hi, Miss Marble. We've been so excited about this all week... me and Merle. We can hardly sleep at night... just waiting to see little Noodle's face. And, shit, we usually sleep pretty good. Me and Annette is really gonna have to settle down... once we get Noodles home. It's going to be a lot different with a baby around. Yes, well, as I said... Mr. Marble and l that you will get Noodles... but, first, have a seat... so I can just briefly recheck your application. Don't say anything, all right? Just don't say a word. When are you going to get her out of here? Come on, little Noodles, you just found a new home. That's real nice! Poor fucking Alice dies giving birth... you can't even bother to move the body... and now the bitch has sold the kid! Poor baby! And you, you little suckling... can't even get me my tranquilizers! You shithead, where are my pills? That bitch can afford it. She's got another couple grand coming for this one. Can't she at least give me my fucking pills? I said don't talk to me when I come down here. I don't give a fuck what you said, you fucking pig! Get this body out of here! It's making me sick! When are they gonna get another one? What poor girl will they get next? I know they're gonna get another one. Just like when I came here, I replaced somebody, didn't l?"

In other words... that thin-shelled ovum of the domestic fowl... will never be safe... as long as there are chicken layin'... and I'm alive because I am your eggman... and there ain't a better one in town.

In just happens. Then I think about my position, my social standing... just like you two do, and I just play! I just make believe that I am you! I know it isn't reality! I know that I'm really me! Haven't I been a faithful servant for two years now? Haven't I given you my all in this job? Oh, you've been faithful, all right... faithful in your stupidity, faithful in your laziness..."

You can do anything you like. Just please let me out of this house. When will the Marbles be back? Tell us! I don't know. I swear I don't know. They locked me in here this morning. They fired me.

And you're going to pay royally, bitch. Let this be a lesson to you... just in case there is reincarnation. It's virtually impossible to be filthier than Divine. I didn't get my reputation for nothing, you know. But you found out too late, Connie. Yeah, it's too late. 'Cause you and shithead here... aren't going to be around tomorrow. No, you're not going to be around... to put your newfound knowledge to use. 'Cause you're going to be dead, Connie. Dead! Dead! Dead! That's tight, Crackers... it's so tight it makes their blood hurt. Just make sure they don't make another sound... because I don't think l'd be able... to control myself if they made any more noise. l'd just have to kill them right now! I just won't be able to wait! I know what you mean, Babs. I feel like ripping them apart myself. They ain't gonna be doing much talking, are you? Come on, children... we can't keep the photographers waiting. And we're going to give them a story... that will knock the \"\"Newsday\"\"... right off its fucking boring little ass! Come on, Connie and Raymond. You have a personal appearance to make. John Vader of the \"\"Midnight\"\" here... looking for Divine somewhere in Phoenix, Maryland. Divine, you're looking fantastic. Why, thank you, Mr. Vader. I'm so glad you could come. Nat Curzan here from \"\"The Tattler.\"\" Well, good afternoon, Mr."

Are you a willing accomplice... to these murders that are about to take place? This is not exactly a murder, Mr. Goldstein. This is a court, a kangaroo court... as the headlines could scream. Not a mere murder as you would call it. lf we were involved in merely another murder... it could hardly be headlines. It's not just the publicity. My mama couldn't go on with her everyday life... with this kind of shit going on. My mama was not the aggressor in this little war we had. She only did what had to be done. In was suicide on their part. And, Cotton... I notice a smile on your lips. Does murder make you happy? Murder merely relieves tension, Mr. Curzan. For murder to bring happiness, one must already be happy... and I am completely at peace with myself... totally happy. Give me more questions. Divine, are you a lesbian? Yes. I have done everything. Does blood turn you on? In does more than turn me on, Mr. Vader. In makes me come. And more than the sight of it, I love the taste of it. The taste of hot, freshly killed blood. Could you give us some of your political beliefs? Kill everyone now. Condone first-degree murder. Advocate cannibalism, eat shit. Filth are my politics. Filth is my life. Take whatever you like. How's this for a center spread? -Jesus. -Christ Almighty! OK, Divine, where will you go now? I'm sure you're aware that after the execution... you will be the subject of an extensive search. To another city... to set up headquarters once again. Of course... I cannot reveal to you the exact location. Patience, Mr. Vader, patience. Another time, another story. And now for the trial. You sit here. Back here? Sit down. No pictures during the trial, please. This is a court of law. I call to the stand Miss Cotton. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?",

Patty Hitler gave me all the information we need... to solve this case. Two would-be filth balls named Connie and Raymond Marble... are responsible for this deed. And now for the strangest nudity I ever filmed. l've got to take a little rest myself. What's the matter, Cotton? What's the matter? They must have done it. There's boll weevils in my bed. A big subplot that was cut from the film... was the revenge murder of Cookie the spy. Sharpen your blades, Cotton. We got some cutting to do. I'm using a gun on this one. I'm not breaking my nails this time. I might need them for scratching. Upstairs. That's her room. She better be awake. It's so dull when they're sleeping. Where's Cookie? Cookie? Who are you? We know she's here. Where is she? She's not here. What is it? Die, bitch! Rivers of gore! Oh, God, you're beautiful, Crackers. It's not just Babs I love anymore. In used to be, but now it's you, too. Both of you I love so much. It's your mind, your imagination... that filthy mind with rotten ideas. And your face-- that beautiful, beautiful face. You like it, baby? My face is yours to look at... as long as you keep looking back. A lot of people like cunt, you know. Men, women. But your eyes are like a cunt to me, honey. You can look and look and look... and still I wake up wishing you were there... watching me twenty-four hours a day. Them cunt eyes. Cunt eyes? What was I thinking about? Was your cutting and hacking successful, my children? Oh, Babs, it was a ball and a half doing it again... a real feeling of true liberation. Why, Cookie won't be doing any more spying on anybody else. You can be sure of that. She looked like a piece of raw ham..."
