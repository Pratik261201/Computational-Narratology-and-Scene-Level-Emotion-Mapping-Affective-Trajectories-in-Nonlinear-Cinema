The 3 guys rob the jewelry store. Sit back and relax. You wait for 'em to come out. Then you drive 'em straight to Kam Tin junkyard. The rest is all set up. Deal? What if my car breaks down? What about red lights? I can't run 'em. Pretend they're green. Don't spoil everything. We only get one chance. What if the engine dies? I'll be in my car. I'll pick you up. Excuse me! What will I drive? A van. Too slow to lose the cops. Do you trust me? Yes. But give me the van first. I want to test drive it. No problem. They should try somewhere else. It's too dangerous. Why? Too many traffic lights. One red light and we're dead. Here. For your daughter's birthday. Something kids like? It's all the rage. See if she likes it. I can always change it. I put your shop on the market. Let's talk about it later. Leave the talking to later. You really want to sell your shop? Sam, we're buddies... I saw you talk to Fai. I don't know what your are up to. Don't do anything dumb. Look on the bright side, antique dealer. Making money, that's all we think of. If it was easy, you'd be rich, not a taxi driver. Antique dealer, you're hard-pressed, like us. We're all hard-pressed. Never mind. I can help you find a solution. Is it money? I know a place that'll make you rich. Here's my card. I've given you the option. Up to you to decide if you're interested. Here's a gold coin. The antique dealer will know what it's worth. I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. My husband's infertile. The doctors confirmed it. He's gonna find out. What should I do? And he's been giving me pills. What pills? Are you sick? No. That's why I'm scared. He says they're vitamins, but he won't show me the bottle. He bought an insurance policy in my name. I'm scared. His first wife disappeared in strange circumstances. He was living off the insurance money. But it's all gone. He's hard-pressed. Don't worry. I'll have him watched. He won't hurt you. Mr Lee, it'd be a shame to melt it. Never mind. I need money. Mok? What is it, Sam? The gold coin... What? It's unusual. I want you to take a look. Got the guy's card? Chan Fok Shui... Let's call him, get to the bottom of this.",

      "raw_text": "And go where? You said you'd get rid of my husband. He knows about us, he'll kill me. There's about 300 ounces of gold... It's worth over 1 million dollars. Sam, if we take the robe apart, it's not worth anything. Antiques have no set price. We must keep it intact. What does that mean? No set price? What will we make? What's that for? To show it to an expert. Was I in it? No. I'll take a souvenir photo. Where are you? In a bar, with clients. Which bar? I'll join you. Don't say. She knows the cop. What did you say? What did you say? I saw them chatting in the cybercaf?. She took her life to be with her husband. There you are. Where were you all evening? A business meeting. Business? What business? We need money! We'll lose the house! Did you see May? Tell me, did you see her? Go to her and don't come back! Go! And don't come back! Go! Go! And don't come back! Go! Go! \"Until mountains crumble...\" \"streams run dry...\" \"Until thunder rumbles in winter, snow falls in summer.\" This will calm you down. I'm sorry. \"The police confirm an unidentified male was killed\" \"by a stolen police pistol.\" \"The police are tracing the cartridges to owner.\" \"Anyone who knew the victim should contact the authorities.\" The factory's far from the center. 35,000 square feet. It's empty. The owner's gone. He wants to kill me. I'm gonna die like his ex-wife. She died in a car crash. Nothing suspicious. Otherwise I'd arrest him. \"The body found yesterday\" \"at Wing Lok St.\" \"Still hasn't been identified.\" \"The.38 cartridges at the crime scene\" \"do come from a police pistol.\" \"The police have issued a warrant against its owner.\" Where's Mok? Antique dealer! He's not here. It's still here. Who is Mok? Tell me about him. He was in the army, he killed before. How did he get the money to open this shop? He sold some antiques he found for a fortune. If he's rich, why's he selling his shop? His shares failed. Know him well? Not really... We were only drinking buddies. As for you, you like cars, your mom is a cook... I don't know much about you either. Sometimes I don't even know myself. Perhaps when it's over, we'll know each other better. I saw him at the stall.

Sam, if we take the robe apart, it's not worth anything. Antiques have no set price. We must keep it intact. What does that mean? No set price? What will we make? What's that for? To show it to an expert. Was I in it? No. I'll take a souvenir photo. Where are you? In a bar, with clients. Which bar? I'll join you. Don't say. She knows the cop. What did you say? What did you say? I saw them chatting in the cybercaf?. She took her life to be with her husband. There you are. Where were you all evening? A business meeting. Business? What business? We need money! We'll lose the house! Did you see May? Tell me, did you see her? Go to her and don't come back! Go! And don't come back! Go! Go! And don't come back! Go! Go! \"Until mountains crumble...\" \"streams run dry...\" \"Until thunder rumbles in winter, snow falls in summer.\" This will calm you down. I'm sorry. \"The police confirm an unidentified male was killed\" \"by a stolen police pistol.\" \"The police are tracing the cartridges to owner.\" \"Anyone who knew the victim should contact the authorities.\" The factory's far from the center. 35,000 square feet. It's empty. The owner's gone. He wants to kill me. I'm gonna die like his ex-wife. She died in a car crash. Nothing suspicious. Otherwise I'd arrest him. \"The body found yesterday\" \"at Wing Lok St.\" \"Still hasn't been identified.\" \"The.38 cartridges at the crime scene\" \"do come from a police pistol.\" \"The police have issued a warrant against its owner.\" Where's Mok? Antique dealer! He's not here. It's still here. Who is Mok? Tell me about him. He was in the army, he killed before. How did he get the money to open this shop? He sold some antiques he found for a fortune. If he's rich, why's he selling his shop? His shares failed. Know him well? Not really... We were only drinking buddies. As for you, you like cars, your mom is a cook... I don't know much about you either. Sometimes I don't even know myself. Perhaps when it's over, we'll know each other better. I saw him at the stall.
