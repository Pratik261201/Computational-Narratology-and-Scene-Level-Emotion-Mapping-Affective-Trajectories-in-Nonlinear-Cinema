Your son Jeffrey's here to see you. Hey, Dad. Do you have a Detective Williams still working here? Yes, he's up in room 221. Right up the stairs, through that door. Thanks. Detective Williams? Yes? My name is Jeffrey Beaumont. I live near you. I believe you know my father Tom? - Beaumont's Hardware Store? - Sure I do. I hear he's in the hospital. - How's he doing? - Well, he's OK, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests. That's why I'm home from school. I was at the hospital this morning and, coming home through the field behind Vista, I, uh... found an ear. You did? A human ear? Yeah. I thought I should bring it to you. Yeah, that's right. Let's take a look at it. Yes, that's a human ear, all right. Let's see what the coroner makes of it. Then I want you to show me exactly where you found it. All right. We'll check the morgue records, but I don't recall anything minus an ear. The person may very well still be alive somewhere. What can you tell about the person from the ear? Once the tests are done, quite a lot. Sex, blood type, whether the ear came off a dead person. Also, it looks like the ear was cut off with scissors. - I'm goin' out for a while. - Do you want the car? - No, I'm just gonna walk around. - All right. You're not going down by Lincoln, are you? No, just around the neighborhood. Don't worry. OK, honey. Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams here?",

But I have to ask you not only not to tell anybody about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't. I understand. I'm just real curious, like you said. I was the same way myself when I was your age. - That's what got me into this business. - Must be great. It's horrible, too. I'm sorry, Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway, I know you do understand. Sure. - Thanks for the card for Dad. - You're welcome. Nice to meet you. You, too. - Say hello to Sandy for me. - We will. - Good night, Jeffrey. - Good night. Are you the one that found the ear? How did you know? I just know, that's all. - I remember you from Central. - Are you a senior? Yup. - How is Central these days? - Terrible. - I don't know... boring. - What else is new! So what are you doin' now? I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital. - That's too bad. - Yeah. What do you know about the ear? - Didn't Dad say not to talk about it? - Yeah, but you brought it up. You know anything? I don't know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. Yeah? My room is above my father's office so... Above your father's office? - So I heard a few things about the ear. - Uh-huh. And? Well... there are a couple of cases I get mixed up on. But one name that keeps coming up is this woman singer. She lives in an apartment real close to your house. Close to the field where you found the ear. It's a strange world, isn't it? - Yeah. - Where is this apartment? It's really close by. That's what's so creepy. They had her under surveillance, 'cept I don't know what they found out 'cause she's not my dad's case. So... I guess you gotta get back home pretty soon, huh? Not really. Why? Well, uh... - You... wanna see the building. - Yeah. - Come on, I'll show you. - OK. Hey, baby! Hey, babe! That's her building right there. She lives on the seventh floor. Come on. So, uh... what are you gonna do now that you're home? Help out at my father's hardware store. They're giving me my own hours, which is nice. I used to know a kid that lived there. Had the biggest tongue in the world.",

Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug-spraying rig. I will go to her apartment as a pest-control man. I will spray her apartment. You knock on the door, draw her attention away from me, and I'll jimmy a window. - And what do I say to her at the door? - You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have some Awake! magazines for you. I don't need very much time, just a few seconds. Whaddaya think? I don't know.

I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window. All right? All right. Let's go. Here I go. Wait a minute. What's her name? Oh, brother, Jeffrey. Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor. Look on her mailbox for the number, bright boy. Thanks. Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor. OK. Good luck. Good luck yourself. Three minutes. No sooner. Yes? What is it? Pest control. I gotta do your apartment. - That stuff stinks. - This is new stuff. There's no smell. Good. Just need to do the kitchen. Grand Central Station! It's only the bug man. - That should do it. - Yeah? - Are you all right? - Yeah. What happened? I was about to go to the door when that guy did it for me. - Was it all right? - Yes and no. Did you recognize him? I only saw his back. I think he went out a door at the end of the hall. I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found these keys. Nifty, huh? Yeah, if they open the door. Yeah. So, what's next? - Are you game for more? - I owe you one since I goofed this one up. You didn't goof it up. But... you still owe me one. I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight. It's Friday. Do you have a date? Yeah. I do. Well, that does that. - You really wanna do this, don't you? - I don't want you to get involved. I do, but if something went wrong... Like you said, they may be involved in murder. OK. I'll tell Mike I'm sick. Just so the record is kept straight, though, I love Mike. What do you want me to do? First we'll have a really nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy Vallens sings. I already know. The Slow Club on Route 7. Great. I'll pick you up about eight? Don't pick me up. My dad might think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock. OK? You better get out before someone sees us. See ya! Wait. Here's to an interesting experience, huh? I'll drink to that! Man, I like Heineken! You like Heineken? - I never really had Heineken before. - You never had Heineken before?

        "No one would think two people like us would be crazy enough to do this. You have a point there. Give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window. All right? All right. Let's go. Here I go. Wait a minute. What's her name? Oh, brother, Jeffrey. Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor. Look on her mailbox for the number, bright boy. Thanks. Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor. OK. Good luck. Good luck yourself. Three minutes. No sooner. Yes? What is it? Pest control. I gotta do your apartment. - That stuff stinks. - This is new stuff. There's no smell. Good. Just need to do the kitchen. Grand Central Station! It's only the bug man. - That should do it. - Yeah? - Are you all right? - Yeah. What happened? I was about to go to the door when that guy did it for me. - Was it all right? - Yes and no. Did you recognize him? I only saw his back. I think he went out a door at the end of the hall. I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found these keys. Nifty, huh? Yeah, if they open the door. Yeah. So, what's next? - Are you game for more? - I owe you one since I goofed this one up. You didn't goof it up. But... you still owe me one. I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight. It's Friday. Do you have a date? Yeah. I do. Well, that does that. - You really wanna do this, don't you? - I don't want you to get involved. I do, but if something went wrong... Like you said, they may be involved in murder. OK. I'll tell Mike I'm sick. Just so the record is kept straight, though, I love Mike. What do you want me to do? First we'll have a really nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy Vallens sings. I already know. The Slow Club on Route 7. Great. I'll pick you up about eight? Don't pick me up. My dad might think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock. OK?

I looked for you in my closet tonight. It's crazy, I know. I don't know where you come from, but... ...I like you. It's not crazy. I like you too. I liked being with you last night. Same here.

See that clock on the wall? Yeah. Five minutes from now, you're not gonna believe what I've told you. Number one. Today I staked out Frank's place with a camera. There's another man involved in all this. I call him the Yellow Man. You saw his back the other day at Dorothy's apartment. Today I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does that prove? Nothing, really. But it's interesting. Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out and meet a well-dressed man carrying an alligator briefcase."
