Just look at all the passion on that wall. Yeah, well, this is a done deal. All but the paperwork. The kid see it? What? The kid. What kind of fucking question is that? We are all gonna be real glad when we get rid of you, Somerset, you know that? There's always these questions with you. Did the kid see it? Who gives a fuck? He's dead. His wife killed him. Anything else has nothing to do with us. Detective Somerset? I'm Detective Mills. Lieutenant, I apologize for interrupting like this... just get in town 20 minutes ago, they dump me here. Look... Mills? I thought we might find a bar someplace. You know, sit, talk... I'd like to get to the precinct. You know, not much time for this transition thing. I meant to ask you something, when we spoke on the phone before. Yeah. Why here? I don't follow. Well, all this effort to get transferred. It's the first question that popped into my head. I guess for the same reasons as you. Or the same reasons you had before you decided to quit, yeah? You just met me. Maybe I'm not understanding the question. It's very simple. You actually fought to get reassigned here. I've just never seen it done that way before. I thought I could do some good, look, it would be great for me if we didn't start out kicking each other in the balls. If you're calling the shots, lieutenant... Yes. I want you to look and I want you to listen, Ok? Now, I wasn't standing around guarding the Taco Bell. I've worked Homicide five years. Not here. I understand that. Well, over the next seven days, detective, you'll do me the favor of remembering that. Hello? Yeah. Ok. Say it again. I thought we moved here to get away from tractor pulls. Serpico's gotta go. Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid of this little crusty. This eye, Serpico. Did you get it? Got it. Good. Coffee? No? Nothing's been touched. Everything's like I found it. What time was death established? Like I said... I didn't touch anything. But he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about 45 minutes now. Wait a minute. No one bothers with vital signs? Did I stutter? This guy ain't breathing unless he started breathing spaghetti sauce.",

I did that shit for a long time. And? Badge on my belt says detective. That's the same as yours. Look, I made a decision. I had to consider the integrity of the scene. Couldn't worry whether you thought you were getting enough on the playing field. Hey, man... just don't be jerking me off, that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off. He's been dead a long time. And I can tell you, it was not from poison. Oh, man. How does someone let themselves go like that? It took four orderlies just to get him on the table. How'd the fat fuck ever fit out his front door?

District Attorney Martin Talbot is taking questions from reporters. There could be a conflict of interest? That is ridiculous to the point of being offensive. There is no conflict whatsoever. And any claim that there could be is irresponsible. Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot. Now hold on. It's rumored you're far from apprehending a suspect? Let me address that. I've just come from a meeting of law enforcement officials and they've assured me, they have their very best men on this. This will be the very definition of swift justice. Pardon me, George. Somerset. Come in. Have you heard the news? Nope, haven't heard. Eli Gould was found murdered this morning. Someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death. Wrote the word greed on the floor. Greed? Yeah, in blood. Mills is heading up the investigation. Excuse me. Excuse me? Could you not do that, please? Oh, Ok. Well, good for him. What in the hell are you gonna do with yourself out there, Somerset? Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm. Fix my house. Don't you feel it? Don't you feel that feeling? You're not gonna be a cop anymore. That's the whole idea. I don't think you're leaving. Hell, you can't leave all this. Guy's out walking his dog. Gets attacked. His watch is taken, his wallet. While he's lying there on the sidewalk, helpless... his attacker stabs him in both eyes.",

No. I will not discuss the details of this ongoing investigation so don't even bother asking. What you guys got for me? Nothing yet, boss. Why don't you guys, go get a coffee. We have this breaking story for you. We're going to go live downtown... where defense attorney Eli Gould was found murdered this morning. District Attorney Martin Talbot is taking questions from reporters. There could be a conflict of interest? That is ridiculous to the point of being offensive. There is no conflict whatsoever. And any claim that there could be is irresponsible. Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot. Now hold on. It's rumored you're far from apprehending a suspect? Let me address that. I've just come from a meeting of law enforcement officials and they've assured me, they have their very best men on this. This will be the very definition of swift justice. Pardon me, George. Somerset. Come in. Have you heard the news? Nope, haven't heard. Eli Gould was found murdered this morning. Someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death. Wrote the word greed on the floor. Greed? Yeah, in blood. Mills is heading up the investigation. Excuse me. Excuse me? Could you not do that, please? Oh, Ok. Well, good for him. What in the hell are you gonna do with yourself out there, Somerset? Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm. Fix my house. Don't you feel it? Don't you feel that feeling? You're not gonna be a cop anymore. That's the whole idea. I don't think you're leaving. Hell, you can't leave all this. Guy's out walking his dog. Gets attacked. His watch is taken, his wallet. While he's lying there on the sidewalk, helpless... his attacker stabs him in both eyes."

You eat. Everybody, stay outside. Victor. Somerset! Somerset! Yeah? What? We had him. What are you talking about? The fucking photographer in the fucking stairs. We had him and we let him go. You're sure this is him? Yup, good, good. Yup. Yeah, good, get it out. All right. We've got nothing, no pay stubs, no appointment books, no addresses. This is the best, this receipt. Keep looking.

Your wife called. Get yourself an answering machine. Detective? After this, I'm gone. Detective? No big surprise. Detective! You're looking for me. Hey! Don't you fucking move. On the fucking floor. Keep away from him! On the fucking floor. I know you. Now. Get down. Get down on your stomach, you piece of shit. Now. All the way! All the way, fucker! Down! Faster. Faster. Faster, fucker. Now. Nose on the ground. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this? I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please. Goddamn it. He cuts the skin off the tips of his fingers. That's why we couldn't find one single usable print in his apartment. Looks like he's been doing it for a quite sometime. What about the bank accounts? The guns? So far everything's a dead end. No credit history. No employment records. His bank account's only 5 years old and it was started with cash. We're even trying to trace his furniture. About only thing we know about that guy right now, is that he's independently wealthy, well-educated and totally insane. Because he's John Doe by choice. Ok, so when do we get to question him? You don't. He going to court now. What? I'm telling you, there's no way he'd turn himself in. It doesn't make any sense. Well, there he sits. It's not supposed to make any sense. He's not finished. No, he's pissing in our faces. We're just taking it like idiots. You know what I'm talking about. For the first time ever, you and I are in total agreement. He wouldn't just stop. So, what the fuck, man? He's two murders away from completing his masterpiece. We'll wait for his plea. My client says there are two more bodies. Two more victims, hidden away. He will take Detectives Mills and Somerset to these bodies, but only Detective Mills and Somerset, only at 6:00 today. Why us? He says he admires you. It's part of the game. The client claims if the detectives do not accept this these bodies will never be found. Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot. We've got him. Downstairs, locked up. Done deal. He's gonna get his free room and board, get his free cable TV. Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable. Why are we having this conversation?",

How happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity. That hurts my feelings. I would never... You wouldn't because there's consequences. It's in those eyes of yours, though. Nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work. I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner. Wait a minute, I thought all you did was kill innocent people. Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny? An obese man. A disgusting man who could barely stand up. A man if you saw him in the street, you'd point him out to your friends so they'd join you in mocking him. A man, who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal. And after him, I picked the lawyer. You both must have to secretly thank me for that one. This is a man who dedicated his life, to making money by lying with every breath that he could muster, to keeping murderers and rapists on the streets. Murderers? A woman. Murderers, John, like yourself? A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bear to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside? A drug dealer. A drug dealing pederast, actually.

        "John? I doubt I enjoyed it any more, than Detective Mills would enjoy time alone with me in a room without windows. Isn't that true? How happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity. That hurts my feelings. I would never... You wouldn't because there's consequences. It's in those eyes of yours, though. Nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work. I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner. Wait a minute, I thought all you did was kill innocent people. Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny? An obese man. A disgusting man who could barely stand up. A man if you saw him in the street, you'd point him out to your friends so they'd join you in mocking him. A man, who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal. And after him, I picked the lawyer. You both must have to secretly thank me for that one. This is a man who dedicated his life, to making money by lying with every breath that he could muster, to keeping murderers and rapists on the streets. Murderers? A woman. Murderers, John, like yourself? A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bear to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside? A drug dealer. A drug dealing pederast, actually.
