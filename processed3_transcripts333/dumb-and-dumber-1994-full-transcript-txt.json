You go straight ahead, and, uh, you make a left over the bridge. That's a lovely accent you have. - New Jersey? - Austria. Austria! Ha ha! Well, then... G'day, mate. Let's put another shrimp on the barbie. Let's not. Oh. Now, who's got the wiener schnitzel? Beautiful. There you go, Dolf. There you go, buddy. Yeah. Let's see. Next, we got roast beef au jus. Who's got the roast beef au jus? Stella, beautiful. Bon appetit, Stella. Oui oui, yeah. Walk away. Go on. Go on. Last but not least... foot-long! Who's got the foot-long? There you... very funny, rascal. Very funny. In your dreams. Harry, why haven't you dropped those dogs off at the show yet? Uh, sir, I didn't want to send them to a performance on an empty stomach, sir. - Get a move on it! - Yes, sir. Mutt cutts. 10-4. Whew. Suck me sideways. Hello. How are you? Uh-uh-uh... uh... uh-uh-uh... I'll be out in one minute. Ow. Why are you going to the airport? Flying somewhere? How'd you guess? I saw your luggage. Then when I noticed the airline ticket, I put two and two together. So where're you headed? Aspen. Mmm... California. Beautiful. Name's Christmas, Lloyd Christmas. I'm Mary Swanson. This isn't my real job, you know. - No? - Nope, my friend Harry and I are saving up our money to open our own pet store. That's nice. - I got worms. - I beg your pardon? That's what we're going to call it... I Got Worms. We're going to specialize in selling worm farms, you know, like ant farms. What's the matter? A little tense about the flight? Something like that. There's really nothing to worry about, Mary. Statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport, you know, like in a head-on crash or flying off a cliff or getting trapped under a gas truck... That's the worst. I have this cousin... well, I had this cousin. Lloyd, could you keep your eyes on the road, please? Oh. Yeah. Good thinking. Can't be too careful. A lot of bad drivers out there. Hey, watch it! Okay, gang, you know the rules... no humping, no pushing, no sniffing heinies. Where have you been? My dogs were supposed to be here 40 minutes ago! Now I hardly have any time to primp them.",

I'm sick and tired of being a nobody. But most of all... I'm sick and tired of having nobody. Okay, Lloyd. Aspen it is. You'd better not be foolin'. Okay okay, just let it out. Have a good cry. Come on. Okay. Okay, that's enough. Lloyd, what are you doing? It feels like you're running at an incredible rate, Harry. Would you quit it? We're not even through Connecticut yet, and already you're annoying me. - Sorry. - Jeez. - We're really doing it, aren't we? - Yeah. Hey, where'd you get those? I bought them when we filled up. Well... We're supposed to talk about all expenditures, Lloyd. We're on a very tight budget. This didn't come out of our travel fund. Oh. No, I was able to raise 25 extra bucks before we left. Where did you get 25 extra bucks? I sold some stuff to Billy in 4C. The blind kid? Yeah! Yeah. What did you sell him, Lloyd? Stuff. - What kind of stuff? - I don't know. A few baseball cards, a sack of marbles... Petey. Petey? You sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Lloyd, that-that... what are you... Petey didn't even have a head! Harry, I took care of it.

Come on. Okay. Okay, that's enough. Lloyd, what are you doing? It feels like you're running at an incredible rate, Harry. Would you quit it? We're not even through Connecticut yet, and already you're annoying me. - Sorry. - Jeez. - We're really doing it, aren't we? - Yeah. Hey, where'd you get those? I bought them when we filled up. Well... We're supposed to talk about all expenditures, Lloyd. We're on a very tight budget. This didn't come out of our travel fund. Oh. No, I was able to raise 25 extra bucks before we left. Where did you get 25 extra bucks? I sold some stuff to Billy in 4C. The blind kid? Yeah! Yeah. What did you sell him, Lloyd? Stuff. - What kind of stuff? - I don't know. A few baseball cards, a sack of marbles... Petey. Petey? You sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Lloyd, that-that... what are you... Petey didn't even have a head! Harry, I took care of it.

The boys are holed up in a little love-nest for the night. I think they're a little bit strange. What the hell are these guys up to? I mean, is it possible that they could be feds? Highly unlikely from what I've seen. Sir, did you ever hear of the concept of other people? Um... me being that for the phone, sir. Oh, you turned your back on me. Ho ho ho! He got me mad. I almost like it. You and Shay were supposed to grab that bag - so we could end this shit! - Here's your drink, baby. Do you know the damage I could do to you? Hold on a minute. Hmm. But that's not your problem. You didn't know. Get off the phone. Get off the pho... I'm sorry, Mr. Andre. You were saying? Look, Mental, these jokers have got a lot of money and it belongs to me!"

Anybody can make a mistake. Come on, stop being a baby! So we backtracked a tad! A tad?! A tad, Lloyd? You drove almost 1/6 of the way across the country in the wrong direction! Now we don't have enough money to get to Aspen! We don't have enough money to get home! We don't have enough money to eat! We don't have enough money to sleep! Well, it's not gonna do us any good to sit here whining about it. We're in a hole. We're just going to have to dig ourselves out. Okay, all right. You're right. You're absolutely right, Lloyd. Oh, well, pardon me, Mr. Perfect! I guess I forgot that you never, ever make a mistake! Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry! Wait up! Got room for one more if you still want to go to Aspen.

Oh! That sure is warm. We're there. Got a little nippy going through the pass back there. Isn't this incredible? - What more could two single guys want? - How about some food? I swallowed a big June bug when we were driving. I'm not really hungry. Well, I'm starving. Ho... Jeez, look at the butt on that. Yeah. He must work out. Hey! Why don't we get busy and deliver the briefcase to Mary? If I know her as well as I think I do she'll invite us right in for tea and strumpets. Good plan. Where does she live? I don't know. What's her last name? I'll look it up. Uh... You know, I don't really recall. Starts with an \"S.\" S-swim, Swamie, S-slippy, Slappy, Slimin, Solmon, Simin, Sal, Swenson, Swanson?

We couldn't have done it without you. We've been following you guys all the way from Providence. What's going on, Harry? Your name is Harry, isn't it? Yeah, she-she grabbed me down the lobby, explained what was up. Then they slapped this bulletproof vest on me and gave me a gun. But what if he shot you in the face? What if he shot me in the face? That's a risk we were willing to take. How come I didn't get a gun? Did you get a gun? You were right, Lloyd. She was definitely worth the trip. Yeah. She's something, ain't she, Harr? I'm glad we were able to help her out. - Honey! - Easy easy. - You're okay. - Okay, I'm just a little sore. I'm sorry. Oh, sweetie. Oh, baby, I missed your loving. Honey, there's someone I want to introduce you to. He's the kindest, gentlest man I've ever met. - Will you meet him? - Sure. He's got a gun! Lloyd? Lloyd! Huh? I said this is my husband Bobby. - Oh. Hi, Bobby. - Hi. - I'm so happy for you. - Thank you. Thank you both very much. I owe you both a debt of gratitude. Thank you. I can't believe this, Lloyd. First Mary dumps us, then the cops take our nest egg. - Then our hog breaks down. - Yeah! When are we ever gonna catch a break? Hi, y'all. Hi, guys! We're going on a national bikini tour, and we're looking for two oil boys who can grease us up before each competition. You are in luck! There's a town about three miles that way. I'm sure you'll find a couple guys there. Okay. Thanks. Bye! Do you realize what you've done? - Hey! - Lloyd! Lloyd! You'll have to excuse my friend. He's a little slow. The town is back that way. Wow. Two lucky guys are gonna be driving around with those girls for the next couple of months. Yeah, don't worry. We'll catch our break too. - Just gotta keep our eyes open. - Yeah. - You're it. - You're it. You're it. Quitsies. You're it. Anti-quitsies, double-stamp. You're it. Anti-quitsies, triple-stamp. - No erasies, none at all. - You can't triple-stamp. Yes, if you have a double-stamp, of course you can. You can't triple-stamp! You can't if you have a double-stamp! You can't triple-stamp... the rule! You can't triple-stamp a double-stamp, Lloyd!",
        "Lloyd! Lloyd!"
