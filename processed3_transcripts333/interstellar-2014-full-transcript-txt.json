      "raw_text": "Well, my dad was a farmer. Um, like everybody else back then. Of course, he didn't start that way. Computer says you're too tight. - Nah, I got this. - Crossing the Straights. - Shutting it down, Cooper. - No! - Shutting it all down. - No, I need power up! Dad? Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed. - I thought you were the ghost. - No. There are no such things as ghosts, babe. Grandpa says you can get ghosts. Maybe that's because Grandpa's close to being one himself. Back to bed. Were you dreaming about the crash? Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh. The wheat had died. The blight came and we had to burn it. And we still had corn. We had acres of corn. But, uh, mostly we had dust. I guess I can't describe it. It was just constant. Just that steady blow... of dirt. We wore, um, little strips of sheet... sometimes over our nose and mouth... so that we wouldn't breathe so much of it. When we set the table, we always set the plate... upside-down. Glasses or cups, whatever it was... upside-down. Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on! Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101. - Check? - Yes, sir. Not at the table, Murph. Dad, can you fix this? What the heck did you do... - to my lander? - Wasn't me. Let me guess. It was your ghost? It knocked it off. It keeps knocking books off. No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass. - Hey. - I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist. Dad, tell her. Well, it's not very scientific, Murph. You said science was about admitting what we don't know. - She's got you there. - Hey. Start looking after our stuff. Coop. All right, Murph, you want to talk science? Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost. No, you got to go further. You got to record the facts, analyze, get to the how and the why... then present your conclusions. Deal? - Deal. - All right. - Have a good day at school. - Hold up. Parent-teacher conferences. Parent. Not grandparent. Slow down, turbo! - That's not a dust storm. - Nelson's torching his whole crop. Blight? They're saying it's the last harvest for okra. Ever. He should've planted corn like the rest of us. Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley. She's single. What's that supposed to mean? Repopulating the earth. Start pulling your weight, young man. Why don't you start minding your own business, old man?",

Shut it, Tom! - What'd you do, Murph? - Ah, she didn't do nothing. - Blew a tire is all. - Murphy's Law. Shut up! - Grab the spare, Tom. - That is the spare. Get the patch kit! How am I supposed to patch it out here? You got to figure it out. I'm not always gonna be here to help you. What's going on, Murph? Why did you and Mom name me after something that's bad? We didn't. Murphy's Law? Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad will happen. What it means is whatever can happen will happen. And that sounded just fine with us. Whoa! Get in. Get in, let's go. What about the flat tire? Yeah. It's an Indian Air Force drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm. Take the wheel, Tom. Go, go, go! Keep that aimed right at it. Faster, Tom. I'm losing it. Right at it. Stay on it. Here we go. Whoa. Nice one, Tom. Dad? I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop! Dad! Tom! You told me to keep driving. Well, I guess that answers the old \"if I asked you to drive off a cliff\" scenario. - We lost it. - No, we didn't. Want to give it a whirl? This way. Go. Let's lay her down right there at the edge of the reservoir. Nicely done. How long you think it's been up there? Delhi Mission Control went down, same as ours... - ten years ago. - Heh. So for ten years? - Why did it come down so low? - I don't know. Maybe the sun cooked its brain or it was looking for something. - What? - Give me a large flatblade. Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know. What are you gonna do with it? I'm gonna give it something socially responsible to do... like drive a combine. Can't we just let it go? It wasn't hurting anybody. This thing needs to learn how to adapt, Murph... like the rest of us. How's this work? You guys come with? I've got class. This one needs to wait. - What did you do? - They'll tell you about it in there. - Am I gonna be mad? - Not with me. - Just please try not to. - Hey. Relax. I got this. Little late, Coop. Yeah, we had a flat. And I guess you had to stop off at the Asian fighter plane store. No, actually, sir, that's a surveillance drone. With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian. Take a seat.

The Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources... into rockets and other useless machines. \"Useless machines.\" If we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century, then... we need to teach our kids about this planet, not tales of leaving it.

Then she'd have been the one listening to this instead of me... which would have been a good thing, because she was always... the calmer one. I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

Her favorite team is playing. There's gonna be candy and soda and... I think I'll take her to that. How'd it go? I got you suspended. - What? - Cooper. This is Cooper. Go. Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire. Just reset the controllers. I did that. Now you should come take a look. One by one they've been peeling off the fields and heading over. Something's interfering with the compass. Magnetism or some such. Nothing special about which book. I've been working on it, like you said. - I counted the spaces. - Why? In case the ghost is trying to communicate. I'm trying Morse. Morse? Yeah. - Dots and dashes, used... - I know what Morse code is, Murph. I just don't think your bookshelf's trying to talk to you. Had to reset every compass clock and GPS to offset for the anomaly. - Which is? - I don't know. If the house was built on magnetic ore... we'd have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor. I hear your meeting at the school didn't go so well. Heh. You heard? It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald. Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers. When I was a kid... it felt like they made something new every day. Some... gadget or idea. Like every day was Christmas. But six billion people... just try to imagine that. And every last one of them trying to have it all. This world isn't so bad. And Tom will do just fine. You're the one who doesn't belong. Born 40 years too late, or 40 years too early. My daughter knew it, God bless her. And your kids know it. Especially Murph. Well, we used to look up in the sky and wonder... at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt. Cooper, you were good at something... and you never got a chance to do anything with it. I'm sorry. You didn't expect... this dirt that was giving you this food... to turn on you like that and destroy you. In April... I believe I'm right... Fifteenth of April, I think. This happened about 1:30 when that thing... came off the top of that canyon. In my day, we had real ballplayers. Who are these bums? In my day, people were too busy... fighting over food to even play baseball.",

Her favorite team is playing. There's gonna be candy and soda and... I think I'll take her to that. How'd it go? I got you suspended. - What? - Cooper. This is Cooper. Go. Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire. Just reset the controllers. I did that. Now you should come take a look. One by one they've been peeling off the fields and heading over. Something's interfering with the compass. Magnetism or some such. Nothing special about which book. I've been working on it, like you said. - I counted the spaces. - Why? In case the ghost is trying to communicate. I'm trying Morse. Morse? Yeah. - Dots and dashes, used... - I know what Morse code is, Murph. I just don't think your bookshelf's trying to talk to you. Had to reset every compass clock and GPS to offset for the anomaly. - Which is? - I don't know. If the house was built on magnetic ore... we'd have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor. I hear your meeting at the school didn't go so well. Heh. You heard? It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald. Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers. When I was a kid... it felt like they made something new every day. Some... gadget or idea. Like every day was Christmas. But six billion people... just try to imagine that. And every last one of them trying to have it all. This world isn't so bad. And Tom will do just fine. You're the one who doesn't belong. Born 40 years too late, or 40 years too early. My daughter knew it, God bless her. And your kids know it. Especially Murph. Well, we used to look up in the sky and wonder... at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt. Cooper, you were good at something... and you never got a chance to do anything with it. I'm sorry. You didn't expect... this dirt that was giving you this food... to turn on you like that and destroy you. In April... I believe I'm right... Fifteenth of April, I think. This happened about 1:30 when that thing... came off the top of that canyon. In my day, we had real ballplayers. Who are these bums? In my day, people were too busy... fighting over food to even play baseball."

We were on a salvage run... You're sitting in the best-kept secret in the world. Nobody stumbles in here. Nobody stumbles out. Cooper, please. Cooperate with these people. Look.

When they realized that killing other people was... not a long-term solution, then they needed us back. - In secret. - Why secret? Because public opinion wouldn't allow spending on space exploration. Not while you're struggling to put food on the table. Blight. Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year. Now there's just corn. And we're growing more than we ever have. But like the potatoes in Ireland and the wheat in the Dust Bowl... the corn will die. Soon. We'll find a way, professor. We always have. Driven by the unshakable faith the Earth is ours. Not just ours, no. But it is our home. Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen. We don't even breathe nitrogen. Blight does. And as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen.

Hence the bravery. You don't have the resources to visit all 12. No. Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary. Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us some clue as to which worlds have potential. And one system shows promise. One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

The first gravitational anomalies changed everything. Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real. So I started working on a theory and we started building this station. But you haven't solved it yet. That's why there's Plan B. The problem is gravity. How to get a viable amount of human life off the planet. This is one way. Plan B: a population bomb. Over 5,000 fertilized eggs weighing in at just under 900 kilos. How would you raise them? With equipment on board, we incubate the first 10. After that, with surrogacy, the growth becomes exponential. Within 30 years, we could have a colony of hundreds. The real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity. This takes care of that. But what about the people here? You just... give up on them? My kids? That's why Plan A is a lot more fun. - How far have you got? - Almost there. You're asking me to hang everything... on an almost. I'm asking you to trust me. Find us a new home. And by the time you return... I will have solved the problem of gravity. I give you my word. Go away! Murph. Go! If you're leaving, just go.

We lose a little fuel, but we save a whole lot of time. - That'll work. - That's good. There's no time for monkey business or chit-chat down there. So, TARS, you should definitely stay here. CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay. If we're talking about a couple years, I could use the time to research gravity. Observations from the wormhole, that's gold to Professor Brand. TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua. Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet. - You got it? - I wouldn't leave you behind...

How far off from Miller's planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift? Just back from the cusp. All right, which is here, just outside of Miller's planet. - Right. - Okay. Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet. Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit around Miller's planet... which would conserve fuel, but we would lose a lot of time... what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet... outside of this time shift, to here? Then we take the Ranger down, we get Miller, we get her samples. We come back, we analyze, we debrief. We're in, we're out. We lose a little fuel, but we save a whole lot of time. - That'll work. - That's good. There's no time for monkey business or chit-chat down there. So, TARS, you should definitely stay here. CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay. If we're talking about a couple years, I could use the time to research gravity. Observations from the wormhole, that's gold to Professor Brand. TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua. Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet. - You got it? - I wouldn't leave you behind... Dr. Brand. - You ready, CASE? - Yup. - You don't say much, do you? - TARS talks plenty for both of us. Detach. - Romilly, are you reading these forces? It's unbelievable."

The nights are... 67 far colder hours. The gravity is a very, very pleasant 80 percent of the Earth's. Now, up here where I landed, the water is alkali... and the air has too much ammonia to breathe for more than just a few minutes... but down at the surface, and there is a surface... the chlorine dissipates. The ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air. To organics. Possibly even to life. We might be sharing this world. These readings are from the surface? Over the years, I've dropped various probes. - How far have you explored? - I've mounted several major expeditions.

        "Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann? Tell us about your world. Our world, we hope. Our world, uh, is cold... stark... but undeniably beautiful. The days are 67 hours long, cold. The nights are... 67 far colder hours. The gravity is a very, very pleasant 80 percent of the Earth's. Now, up here where I landed, the water is alkali... and the air has too much ammonia to breathe for more than just a few minutes... but down at the surface, and there is a surface... the chlorine dissipates. The ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air. To organics. Possibly even to life. We might be sharing this world. These readings are from the surface?
