Mr. Dufresne, describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered. It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around... And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno. What was your response? I told her I would not grant one. \"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno.\" Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to your neighbors. If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset. What happened after you argued with your wife? She packed a bag. She packed a bag to go and stay with... Mr. Quentin. DA: Glenn Quentin. Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club. The man you discovered was your wife's lover. Did you follow her? I went to a few bars first. Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout, and waited. DA: With what intention? DUFRESNE: I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them. When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them. No. I was sobering up. I got back in the car, and I drove home to sleep it off. Along the way, I stopped, and I threw my gun into the Royal River. I feel I've been very clear on this point. Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning and finds your wife in bed with her lover, riddled with .38 caliber bullets. Now, does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me? (Whispers) Yes, it does. Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun into the river before the murders took place? - That's very convenient. - It's the truth. DA: The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found. So, there could be no comparison made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.",

No. This was revenge... of a much more brutal and cold-blooded nature. Consider this. Four bullets per victim. Not six shots fired, but eight.

Nothing left, but all the time in the world to think about it. Most new fish come close to madness the first night. Somebody always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only question is: Who's it gonna be? It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess. I had my money on Andy Dufresne. Lights out!  RED: I remember my first night. Seems like a long time ago. MAN: Yoo-hoo! Hey, fish. Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy. - Boy, are you scared of the dark? - You like it here, new fish? You'll wish your daddy never dicked your mommy. Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes! You taking this down, new fish? There's gonna be a quiz later! - Poke your ass out, give me a first look! - Shh! Keep it down. RED: The boys always go fishing with first-timers. They don't quit till they reel someone in.  Hey, Fat Ass. Fat Ass. Talk to me, boy. I know you're there. I can hear you breathing. Don't you listen to these nitwits. You hear me? This place ain't so bad. I tell you what. I'll introduce you around. Make you feel right at home. I know a couple of big old bull queers that would just love to make your acquaintance. Especially that big, white, m-mushy butt of yours. God! I don't belong here! MAN: We have a winner! FAT ASS: I wanna go home! And it's Fat Ass by a nose! Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy! Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish! FAT ASS: I don't belong here! ALL: Fresh fish! I wanna go home. I want my mommy. MAN: I had your mother. She wasn't that great.  Fresh fish!  What the Christ is this happy horse shit? He took the Lord's name in vain."

Look at his neck, for God's sake. Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.  It's the only... It's the only way they'd let me stay. Come on. This is crazy. You don't want to do this. Put it down.  Come on. Take it easy. You're going to be all right. HEYWOOD: Him? Hell, what about me? Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat. RED: Shit, Heywood, you've had worse from shaving. What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway? Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well. Ain't you heard? His parole's come through. I just don't understand what happened in there. That's all. The old man's as crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse. Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you. - I heard he had you shitting in your pants. - Fuck you! Would you knock it off? Brooks ain't no bug. He's just... He's just institutionalized. Institutionalized, my ass. The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood. 50 years. This is all he knows. In here, he's an important man. He's an educated man. Outside, he's nothing. Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands. Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried. You know what I'm trying to say? Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass. You believe whatever you want, Floyd. But I'm telling you, these walls are funny. First you hate 'em... ..then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes... you get so you depend on 'em. That's institutionalized. JIGGER: Shit. You can never get like that. Oh, yeah? Say that when you've been here as long as Brooks has. Goddamn right. They send you here for life. That's exactly what they take. The part that counts, anyway.  I can't take care of you no more, Jake. You go on, now. You're free. Bye. Good luck, Brooks. BROOKS: Dear fellas... I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.  Watch it, old-timer! Are you trying to get killed? I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid, but now...they're everywhere."

So... one night, like a joke, I say to him, I say, \"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?\" So he says... I got me this job one time bussing tables at a country club. So I could case all these big rich pricks that come in. So I pick out this guy, go in one night and do his place. He wakes up. He gives me shit. So I killed him. Him and this tasty bitch he was with. That's the best part. She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro. But she's married to some other guy. Some hotshot banker. And he's the one they pinned it on. I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard. What amazes me most is you were taken in by it. Sir? Well... it's obvious this fella Williams is impressed with you. He hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up. He's young, not terribly bright. Not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he'd put you in. Sir, he's telling the truth.

There's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is? - Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular. It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end. It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my wife to marry me. We went there for a picnic and made love under that oak. I asked and she said yes. Promise me, Red, if you ever get out, find that spot. At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. A piece of black, volcanic glass. There's something buried under it I want you to have. What, Andy? What's buried under there? You'll have to pry it up to see. No, I'm telling you, the guy is... He's talking funnier. - I'm really worried about him. - We ought to keep an eye on him.

Shit. - About scare me to death, something that big. - Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover. Whatever mistakes I've made, I've paid for them and then some. That hotel, that boat. I don't think that's too much to ask. I don't think you ought to be doing this to yourself, Andy. These are just shitty pipe dreams. I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there and you're in here. And that's the way it is. Yeah, right. That's the way it is. It's down there and I'm in here. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying. Andy. Red. If you ever get out of here, do me a favor. Sure, Andy. Anything. There's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is? - Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular. It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end. It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my wife to marry me. We went there for a picnic and made love under that oak. I asked and she said yes. Promise me, Red, if you ever get out, find that spot. At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. A piece of black, volcanic glass. There's something buried under it I want you to have. What, Andy? What's buried under there? You'll have to pry it up to see. No, I'm telling you, the guy is... He's talking funnier. - I'm really worried about him. - We ought to keep an eye on him. That's fine during the day, but at night he's got that cell all to himself. Oh, Lord. What? Andy come down to the loading dock today."

I look back on the way I was then. A young... stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I wanna talk to him. I wanna try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone. This old man is all that's left. I gotta live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit. (Gate closes) (Siren passes outside) Here you go, miss. Rest room break, boss? You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go. Understand? Yes, sir. RED: 40 years I've been asking permission to piss. I can't squeeze a drop without say-so. There's a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside. All I do any more is think of ways to break my parole... ..so maybe they'd send me back. A terrible thing to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense, where I won't have to be afraid all the time. Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy. Here it is. Much obliged, sir. (Bird calls) ANDY: Dear Red, if you're reading this, you've gotten out. And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You remember the name of the town, don't you? Zihuatanejo. I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready. Remember, Red, hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you and finds you well. Your friend, Andy. RED: Get busy living or get busy dying. That's goddamn right. For the second time in my life, I'm guilty of committing a crime. Parole violation. Of course, I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that. Not for an old crook like me. Fort Hancock, Texas, please. I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.",
