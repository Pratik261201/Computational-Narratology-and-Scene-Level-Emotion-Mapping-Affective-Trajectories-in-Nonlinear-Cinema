Well, there has to be an explanation. Sweetie, it's Vegas. You lose track of time in casinos. There's no windows, there's no clocks. He's probably on a heater. And you never walk away from the table when you're on a heater. You do if you're getting married. - Hello? - Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil. Phil, where the hell are you guys? I'm freaking out. Yeah, listen. Uh... We fucked up. - What are you talking about? - The bachelor party, the whole night. It... Things got out of control, uh... ...and we lost Doug. - What? - We can't find Doug. What are you saying, Phil? We're getting married in five hours. Yeah. That's not gonna happen. To my left a little. Thank you. Okey-dokey. - Whoa, watch it, pervert! - Alan, he's just doing your inseam. - He's getting very close to my shaft. - All done. You can change now. Right. Thanks, Floyd. Thank you very much. All right, buddy, we should get a move on. You know, Doug, I was thinking... If you wanna go to Vegas without me, that is totally cool, you know? What are you talking about? You know, Phil and Stu, they're your buddies, and it's your bachelor party. Come on, Alan. Those two love you. And also, I don't want you to feel like you have to hold back... ...because your wife's brother's there. I just... It's not like that. It's not like that. I already told you, Alan. Okay? We're just spending the night in Vegas. It's no big deal. Besides, you're not just my wife's brother, you're my brother now. I want you to know, Doug, I'm a steel trap. Whatever happens tonight, I will never, ever, ever, speak a word of it. Okay. Yeah, I got it. Thank you. I don't think that... Seriously. I don't care what happens. - I don't care if we kill someone. - What? You heard me. It's Sin City. I won't tell a soul. Okay. I got it. - Thank you. No, thank you. I love you so much. - Ha. I knew it. - Dad. Oh, stop it, I'm just jerking around. Alan, put some pants on. You have weird legs. Yes, Daddy. - His legs look fine, Dad.",

It's one night. Have fun, you deserve it. I know, but we should have gone last weekend. We have so much to do. I... I'm gonna cancel. My brother packed his bag two weeks ago. You're not canceling. - Really? - Yeah. - Two weeks? - Yeah, he's excited. Thanks again for bringing him, by the way. You don't need to thank me, it's nothing. He's a cool guy. It's not nothing and he's not a cool guy... ...so thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, Sid.

Uh, we're gonna take my car. Gonna pick up my friends after this. - Prius? You're taking a Prius to Vegas? - Yeah. You know, when you go to Vegas... ...you gotta go to Vegas. No. Sid. - Really? Come on, we're family now. - You sure? I mean, you love this car. - Doug, it's just a car. Just make sure to put some Armor All on the tires so the sand doesn't seep in. Absolutely. That's easy. Oh, and, uh, don't let Alan drive, because there's something wrong with him. Understood. Oh, and Phil either. I don't like him. I will be the only one driving this car. I promise. Good. Remember, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Ah! Except for herpes. That shit'll come back with you. All right. Hold on. I still need some of your permission slips... ...and $90 for the field trip to the Griffith Observatory next weekend. Pay now, or forever regret missing out on the experience of a lifetime, guys. You're good, you got it. Thanks, Mr. Wenneck. Thank you. Hey. You really came through, thank you. Whoa, Max. What gives? What, no planetarium? My mom won't give me the money.

Come on, just till Barstow. Everybody's passing us. Absolutely not. I promised Sid. I will be the only one driving this car. Besides, you're drinking. Oh, what are you, a cop now? You know I drive great when I'm drunk. True. Don't forget, Phil was always our designated drunk driver. Yeah. You wanna explain it to them, Alan? Guys, my dad loves this car more than he loves me, so, yeah. Aw, whatever. I left my wife and kid at home so I could go with you guys. - You know how difficult that was? - That's really sweet. - Yeah. - Dude, I was being sarcastic. I fucking hate my life. - I may never go back. I might stay in Vegas. - Here we go. Doug, enjoy yourself, because come Sunday... ...you're gonna start dying just a little bit every day. Yeah. That's why I've managed to stay single this whole time, you know? - Oh, really? That's why you're single? - Yeah. Cool. Good to know. - Am I all right over there, Alan? - Yeah, you're good.

I fucking hate my life. - I may never go back. I might stay in Vegas. - Here we go. Doug, enjoy yourself, because come Sunday... ...you're gonna start dying just a little bit every day. Yeah.

You're actually gonna wear that or are you guys fucking with me? It's where I keep all my things. I get a lot of compliments on this. Plus, it's not a man-purse. It's called a satchel. Indiana Jones wears one. So does Joy Behar. - We're going up, guys. - Yeah, that's perfect. Really? We're going up? I'm just saying, it's clearly marked, okay? We are definitely not supposed to be up here. Come on, we're paying for a villa. We can do whatever the fuck we want. - Yeah, but... - Just wedge the door open. - Guys, come on up here. - Fine. How the hell did you find this place? Don't worry about it. Oh! - You all right? - Yeah. - Look at the view up here. - You happy? - This is great. - Whoa! Are you kidding? Alan, how we doing, buddy? - Good. What do you got over there, Alan? That's the Eiffel Tower. Uh-oh. - Right? - A little Jägermeister. - Good idea. - There it is. Good call. On the roof. Um, no, this is good. I'd like to make a toast. To Doug and Tracy. May tonight be... ...but a minor speed bump... ...in an otherwise very long and healthy marriage. - Cheers. - Cheers. Short and sweet. Oh, it's like college. - All right. I wanna talk about something. All right. - I want to... I'd like to... I'd like to say something... ...that I prepared... ...tonight. - All right, Alan. \"Hello. How about that ride in? I guess that's why they call it Sin City. You guys might not know this, but I consider myself a bit of a loner. I tend to think of myself as a one-man wolf pack. But when my sister brought Doug home, I knew he was one of my own. And my wolf pack, it grew by one. So were there two... So there were two of us in the wolf pack."

These gentlemen have kindly volunteered to demonstrate... ...how a stun gun is used to subdue a suspect. Ooh! - That's right. - Wait a sec. What? Now, there's two ways to use a stun gun. Up close and personal. - What the fuck? - Or you can shoot it from a distance. Do I have any volunteers? You wanna come up here and do some shooting? Huh? All right, how about you, young lady? Come on up here. All right. Let's go, handsome, come on. Not you, fat Jesus, slide it on back. You, pretty boy. Fat Jesus. All right, now, it's real simple. All you gotta do is point, aim and shoot. All right? Okay, look. You don't really wanna do this. You can do this. Just focus. Don't listen to this maniac. Let's think this through. Finish him! Oh, fuck. Yeah! Right in the nuts! That was beautiful. - Well done. Give her a hand, everybody. - Good job. Good job. Good job. Well done. Good job. That was great. Good. Hey, we got one more charge left. Anybody wanna do some shooting up here? How about you, big man? Come on up here. Okay, same instructions. Just point, aim and shoot. There you go. That's the stuff. I like the intensity. Eye of the tiger. Good. You're holding 50,000 volts, little man. Don't be afraid to ride the lightning. In the face! In the face! Oh, he's still up. He's still up. - Aah! - No. All right, everybody relax, take it easy. We've seen it before. He just needs a little extra charge. There we go. Some of these big boys, you gotta give them two shots. All right, kids, who wants to get their fingerprints done, huh?",

But if one of my kids went missing on a field trip... ...that would look really bad on me. - What are you getting at? - Yeah, Phil, what are you getting at? No one wants to look bad.

When you knocked out Holmes, that was... Explain. All right, look, we were drugged last night. We have no memory of what happened. It's true. We got in all kinds of trouble last night and now we can't find our friend. If you wanna kill us, go ahead because I don't care anymore. - What are you talking about? - I don't care. Why the fuck would you wanna steal his tiger? We tend to do dumb shit when we're fucked up. - I don't believe these guys, man. - Wait, how did you guys find us? One of you dropped your jacket. Found it in the tigers' cage this morning. That's Doug's. Yeah, Doug. His wallet and his room key is in there. - No, that's our missing friend. I don't give a fuck. - Did you guys see him? I was fast asleep. Because if he was up, this wouldn't have gone down so smoothly. Maybe one of the tigers ate his ass like Omar. Respect. Wha... What happened to Omar? Oh, don't worry about Omar, he's not with us no more. Okay, I know this is asking a lot... ...but do you think we could go to your house and look around... ...see if there's any clues? Absolutely. How else you think we're gonna get the tiger back anyway? - Come on, champ. - I'm sorry? We're not gonna put it in the Bentley. You brought it here, you bring it back. What you think, about 40 minutes? Don't make me come back for him. - That was Mike Tyson. - Yeah, no shit that was Mike Tyson. I'm just saying, he's still got it. Alan. Bud, are you okay? Oh, my God. - Shit! Fuck, where'd he get him? Hey. This does not seem fair. It's Rock, Paper, Scissors. There's nothing more fair. - Alan should do it. - Alan took a punch from Mike Tyson. Come on. For Doug. Why are you peppering the steak? You don't know if tigers like pepper. Tigers love pepper. They hate cinnamon. Phil, just do it. You should do it. I would, but you lost. It wouldn't be right. Okay, I jammed five roofies in there. Just go in there and throw it in to him. Fine. Make sure he eats the whole thing. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Hey, kitty. Hey, sweetie, it's okay. I got a little snack for you. Real important that you eat this, okay? Yeah, just have a little... Shit! What do we do now? We wait."

Cash only. - There's a person in there. Boring. Take nap. Come on. Wait. I'm sorry we're boring you! Doug, it's okay. - You kidnapped our friend! Kidnapper! Wait. Oh, no. You're not going anywhere. Stop. Stop. Run me over. - Okay. Whoa. Whoa. Stu, Stu, Stu. Bring money to Big Rock in Mojave Desert at dawn. - What? - Toodle-oo, motherfucker. Well, at least take the bag off his head! Fuck! Oh!
