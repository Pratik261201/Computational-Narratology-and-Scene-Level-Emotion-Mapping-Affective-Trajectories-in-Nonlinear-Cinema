You won't find a better car at a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley. That's Statler Toyota in downtown Hill Valley. NEWSCASTER: The Senate is expected to vote on this today. In other news, officials at the Pacific Nuclear research facility have denied the rumor that a case of missing plutonium was in fact stolen from their vault two weeks ago. A Libyan terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the alleged theft. (ALARM RINGING) However, officials now attribute the discrepancy to a simple clerical error. The FBI, which is investigating the matter, had no comment. (BUZZER BLARES) MARTY: Hey, Doc? Doc? Hello! Anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. (WHISTLES) What's going on? Oh, God. Oh, Jesus! That is disgusting. Where the hell is he? (CLOCKS TICKING) (MACHINE HUMMING) (HUMMING GROWS LOUDER) (LOUD HUMMING) (ELECTRIC GUITAR NOTE PLAYS) (GRUNTS) (GROANING) Whoa! Rock 'n' roll. (ALARM RINGING) Yo. DOC: Marty, is that you? Hey. Hey, Doc. Where are you? Thank God I've found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I made a major breakthrough, and I'll need your assistance. Wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Yeah. Doc, what's going on? Where you been all week? Working. Where's Einstein? Is he with you? Yeah, he's right here. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload. Yeah. I'll keep that in mind. Good. I'll see you tonight. Don't forget now. 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Right. (CLOCKS CHIMING) (CLOCKS CUCKOOING) Are those my clocks I hear? Yeah, it's 8:00. Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow! Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Precisely. Damn! I'm late for school. (MUSIC PLAYING) Jennifer. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you get caught, it'll be four tardies in a row. All right, come on. I think we're safe. You know, this time it wasn't my fault. The doc set all his clocks 25 minutes slow. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr.",

You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here. He was a slacker, too. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Yeah, well, history is gonna change. Next, please. (SYNTHESIZER PLAYING) Okay, guys, let's rock 'n roll. All right. We're the... We're the Pinheads. One, two, three. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring up the next group, please.

Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. I just don't think I'm cut out for music. But you're good, Marty. You're really good, and this audition tape of yours is great. You've gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Yeah, I know. I know. \"If you put your mind to it, \"you can accomplish anything.\" That's good advice, Marty. All right, okay, Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? What if they say I'm no good? What if they say, \"Get out of here, kid. You got no future\"? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man. Come on. He's not that bad. Save the clock tower. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Check out that 4x4. That is hot. Okay. Back her up. Someday, Jennifer. Someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake? Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out underneath the stars. Stop it. What? Does your mom know? About tomorrow night? No, get out of town.

But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, (CAR DRIVING AWAY) And I'm afraid I'm just not very good at confrontations. But the car, Dad. I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad. Do you have any idea how important this was to me? Do you have any clue? I know, and all I can say is, I'm... I'm sorry. Believe me, Marty, you're better off without having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. DAVID: He's absolutely right, Marty. The last thing you need is headaches. (LAUGHING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Kids, we're going to have to eat this cake by ourselves. Your Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. (LORRAINE SIGHS) I think it would be nice if you all dropped him a line. MARTY: Uncle \"Jailbird\" Joey? He's your brother, Mom. Yeah. I think it's a major embarrassment, having an uncle in prison. We all make mistakes in life, children. God damn it. I'm late. David, watch your mouth! You come here and kiss your mother before you go. Come here. Come on, Mom. Make it fast. I'll miss my bus. See you later, Pop. (EXCLAIMS) Time to change that oil. (LAUGHING) Hey, Marty. I'm not your answering service. While you were outside pouting over the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls up a boy is just asking for trouble. Oh, Mother, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age, I never chased a boy or called a boy or sat in a parked car with a boy. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody? Well, it'll just happen. Like the way I met your father. That was so stupid. Grandpa hit him with the car. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Yeah, well. I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. What was it, George? Bird-watching? What, Lorraine? What? Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house.",

But Biff just happens to be my supervisor,  And I'm afraid I'm just not very good at confrontations. But the car, Dad. I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad. Do you have any idea how important this was to me? Do you have any clue? I know, and all I can say is, I'm... I'm sorry. Believe me, Marty, you're better off without having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. DAVID: He's absolutely right, Marty. The last thing you need is headaches.   Kids, we're going to have to eat this cake by ourselves. Your Uncle Joey didn't make parole again.  I think it would be nice if you all dropped him a line. MARTY: Uncle \"Jailbird\" Joey? He's your brother, Mom. Yeah. I think it's a major embarrassment, having an uncle in prison. We all make mistakes in life, children. God damn it. I'm late. David, watch your mouth! You come here and kiss your mother before you go. Come here. Come on, Mom. Make it fast. I'll miss my bus. See you later, Pop.  Time to change that oil.  Hey, Marty. I'm not your answering service. While you were outside pouting over the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls up a boy is just asking for trouble. Oh, Mother, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age, I never chased a boy or called a boy or sat in a parked car with a boy. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody? Well, it'll just happen. Like the way I met your father. That was so stupid. Grandpa hit him with the car. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Yeah, well. I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. What was it, George? Bird-watching? What, Lorraine? What? Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house."

It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all! Doc, you got to help me. You are the only one who knows how your time machine works. Time machine? I haven't invented any time machine. Okay. All right, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license. Expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out loud! I haven't even been born yet. And look at this picture. It's my brother, my sister and me. Look at her sweatshirt, Doc. \"Class of 1984\"? Pretty mediocre photographic fakery. They cut off your brother's hair. I'm telling the truth, Doc. You got to believe me. Then tell me, future boy, (LAUGHING) Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan? The actor? (EXCLAIMS) Then who's vice president?",

You mean like a date? Right!  What kind of date? I don't know. What do kids do in the '50s? They're your parents. You must know them. What are their common interests? What do they like to do together? Nothing. Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Of course! The Enchantment Under the Sea dance! They're supposed to go to this. That's where they kiss for the first time. All right, kid. You stick to your father like glue and make sure he takes her to that dance. George, buddy. Remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine? What are you writing? Uh... Stories. Science fiction stories about visitors coming down to Earth from other planets. Get out of town! I didn't know you did anything creative. Let me read some. Oh. No, no, no, no. I never let anybody read my stories. Why not? Well, what if they didn't like them? What if they told me I was no good? I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. No. No, not hard at all. So, anyway, George. About Lorraine. She really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance."

And where am I going to be? You're gonna be in the car with her. Right, okay. So, right around 9:00, she's going to get very angry with me. Why is she going to get angry with you? Well, because, George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. (EXCLAIMS) You mean you're going to go touch her on her... No. No, George, look. It's just an act, right? Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling through the parking lot. You see us struggling in the car. You walk up, you open the door, and you say... Your line, George. Oh! Hey, you, get your damn hands off her! You really think I ought to swear? Yes, definitely. God damn it, George, swear. Okay. So, now you come up. You punch me in the stomach. I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. You make it sound so easy. I just... I wish I wasn't so scared. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self-confidence.

You've really made a difference in my life. You've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing that I'm going to be around to see 1985. That I'm going to succeed in this! That I'm going to have a chance to travel through time! It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really going to miss you, Marty. I'm really going to miss you. Doc, about the future... No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically.

Oh, Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Keys? How about a ride, mister? Jennifer. Oh, are you a sight for sore eyes! Let me look at you. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. I haven't. You okay? Is everything all right? MARTY: Oh, yeah. Everything is great.   Marty! You've got to come back with me! Where? Back to the future. Wait a minute. What are you doing, Doc? I need fuel. Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car. No, no. Doc, I just got here, okay? Jennifer's here. We're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Well, bring her along. This concerns her, too. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something? No, no, no, no, Marty. Both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty. Something has got to be done about your kids.  Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't have enough road to get up to 88. Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.  Δε σε είδα. Είσαι καλά; Είναι όλα εντάξει; Όλα είναι τέλεια. Πρέπει να έρθεις μαζί μου! - Πού; - Πίσω στο μέλλον. Τι κάνεις, δόκτωρ; Χρειάζομαι καύσιμα. Έλα. Γρήγορα! Μπες στο αμάξι. Όχι, όχι. Μόλις έφτασα. Η Τζένιφερ είναι εδώ. Θα πάμε βόλτα με το καινούργιο αμάξι. Πες της να έρθει. Την αφορά κι εκείνη. Για ποιο πράγμα μιλάς; Τι θα μας συμβεί στο μέλλον; - Θα γίνουμε αλήτες μήπως; - Όχι, Μάρτυ. Κι οι δυο σας θα είστε μια χαρά. Πρόκειται για τα παιδιά σας. Πρέπει να κάνουμε κάτι για τα παιδιά σας. Κάνε όπισθεν. Δε φτάνει ο δρόμος για να πιάσουμε τα 140. Δρόμοι; Εκεί που πάμε δε χρειαζόμαστε δρόμους."
