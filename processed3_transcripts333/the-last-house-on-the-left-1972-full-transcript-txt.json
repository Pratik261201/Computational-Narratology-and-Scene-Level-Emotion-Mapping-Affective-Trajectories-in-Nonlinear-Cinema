      "raw_text": "Hello, Cassie! Hiya, girl. Hello there. Now, let's see. Looks like Mari's getting cards from half the civilized world. Mari Collingwood. Mari Collingwood. Mari Collingwood. You'd think she's the only kid to reach the age of 17. Of course, she is about the prettiest piece I've ever seen. Mari Collingwood, you hurry up! Okay, okay. Drill sergeant. Did you call the repair service? Mmm-hmm. Did you tell them I was a physician and had to have a phone? No, actually, I told them you were an international bookie and I was 10 months pregnant with quintuplets. Hey, what's new in the outside world? Same old stuff, murder and mayhem. What's for dinner tonight? Freezer's full, take your choice. What's that supposed to mean? Mari, I want you to be careful tonight. Your mother tells me the place you're going is in a bad neighborhood. I will, Daddy. No bra? Of course not! Nobody wears those anymore. Nobody except us drill sergeants. Yeah, but look, Estelle. You can see her nipples as plain as day. Daddy, don't be so clinical. But it's immodest. Then I'll get some sandpaper! Look, young lady, when I was your age... When you were my age, you all wore brassieres that made your tits stick out like torpedoes. Tits! What's this \"tits\" business? Sounds like I'm back in the barracks. All right, then. Mammary glands. They used to tie them up like little lunatics in straitjackets - and they stuffed socks in their bras. - Mari! You told me that yourself, Mother. If God had meant women to go around with their busts exposed, Mari Collingwood, he wouldn't have given us clothes! Who are you gonna see tonight? - Bloodlust. - Bloodlust? Yeah, Bloodlust. What's wrong with them? I was just reading about them. Aren't they the guys that dismember live chickens during their act? They only did that once, Daddy. Don't you feel sorry for the chicken? Oh, Daddy, I couldn't tell you the nights I cried myself to sleep over that chicken. Hey, have you seen the car keys? On the table. I think it's crazy. What's crazy? All that blood and violence. I thought you were supposed to be the love generation. Hey, that reminds me. What? Here's a little something for you. Just a gift to tide you over till tomorrow. Oh, Daddy! Daddy. Oh, Mother. It's nice. Well, maybe it'll bring you luck.",

The leaves are beautiful. Yep! They're really starting to change. I guess winter's coming on. Yep. Hey, I changed. I changed this winter. What do you mean, you changed? I mean, my breasts filled out. Yeah, didn't you notice? Look. I mean, they were nothing last summer. I didn't know you last summer. I know. Well, they have. Well, congratulations! Come on.

Loosen her up a little bit. Wait a minute. Oh, baby, don't... Come on, sweetheart. Don't worry about it. You'll have plenty of time to feel the pain. You know, Weasel here is a specialist with a twist."

Anything serious? -Yeah, I'm afraid we blew a rod. -Oh, no. Well, Willie's Esso station is the only garage I know, and they close at 6:00. Well, it wouldn't make any difference anyway.

Okay, well, we'll be in the living room, and you can join us if you like. Okay, just make yourselves comfortable. Much obliged. Come on! Very nice. Very nice. The lady of the house is nice, too. Hey, Krug, I want my fix, man. Go jump! -Krug? -Yeah? Look at this. What? Guess who lives here? I wonder what the odds are on that. Couldn't even tell you. Feel like playing \"Three Thirds of a Ghost\" or something? How would you like me to put my boot up your ass sideways? I'm sorry I don't have anything better to offer you, but... It's been such a confusing day. Hell, you've got a lot to offer. I mean, this food is impeccable. Are you folks on vacation? No. We're sort of on a business trip.
