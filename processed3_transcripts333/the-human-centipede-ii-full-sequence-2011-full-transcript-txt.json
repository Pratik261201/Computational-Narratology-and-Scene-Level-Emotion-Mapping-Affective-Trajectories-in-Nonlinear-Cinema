      "raw_text": "♫ - Ian, please! Could you just calm down? - He did not know I took the car. He will be absolutely fucking furious. - Your dad doesn't have to find out. We can come back and get it tomorrow when we have the keys! - Fuck! Don't even think for half a second you're going to break open that car, mate. So get out of my face. What are you fucking looking at? Stop looking at my girlfriend, midget! - Ian, please! - You want to fucky-fucky her? No way in hell, 'cause let me tell you, there's only one guy who fucks her, and I fuck her real good, so go home and fuck mom now, you demented dwarf! No, please! Please, no! No, please! Please, plea... Don't! Ian! - Hey, I hope you're not time-wasting, you. I've got a dozen people waiting to look at this place, most of them paying cash as well. You got cash? Right, the light switch is somewhere here I think. - Hey, come on, let's get this fucking lease signed, hey? - Hi, this is Marc from USA Actors Management regarding your audition request for our clients Miss Williams and Mr. Kitamura from Human Centipede. Neither is available for the auditions in London right now because they're shooting a movie, but thank you for the interest. Maybe We can do something in the future. Good-bye. - Stop them tears. You're just making Daddy's Willy harder. Oh, my God. Have you shit yourself again? You swine. I've called Dr. Sebring, and he's waiting. Get up! Hello, Martin. Mmm. Martin... come and join us. Well.. Martin, I have your Ventolin. Martin, I'm here today because your mother is very worried about you. - He keeps on talking about a centipede with 12 people. What does that mean? - Now, let's see. A centipede can be considered a phallic symbol. Centipedes are very aggressive creatures. Their bite can be very painful. Maybe he is connecting the pain that a centipede inflicts with the pain inflicted on him through years of psychological and sexual abuse by his father. - I miss my husband. And it's your fault that he's in prison! - Sometimes people that are mentally challenged and have a history of sexual abuse... mutilate their own sexual organs. I'm sorry. I going to have to go. There's nothing to worry about. I'm sure it's just a passing phase. Hmm? Martin. Ah. You're a good boy. Mrs. Lomax. - I've decided to kill us both.",

Oh, yeah, she's a good one. - How much to fuck you up the arse, darling? - For you, darling, 50. - Jesus. Who the fuck are you? What the fuck have you done to yourself? That's right.

If you were a surgeon, you could actually perform that surgery. It's just so scary. It was so grueling being on all fours, so I demanded in my contract that I had to have an hour-long massage every night. I mean, why would I not demand that in my contract? Oh, and the rest of the cast, we all took showers before we shot the centipede stuff, because I mean, you're close to someone's butt, and you don't want to smell anything and... or, you know, whatever.
