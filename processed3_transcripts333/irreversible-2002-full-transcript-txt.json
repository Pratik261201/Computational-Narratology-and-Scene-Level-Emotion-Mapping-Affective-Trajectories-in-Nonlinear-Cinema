No. I'm here with Marcus. - I think he's drunk. - He looks kinda... loaded! Let's go out for dinner sometime. - I'd love to! - I'll tell you everything! - Tell me! Tell me! - What? Don't know yet. - How's it going? - All right. - Promise? Let's talk. - Sure, soon. I'm gonna get a drink. Bye! Stop it! Baci, baci, baci. What are you on? Nothing! Absolutely nothing. I'm clean as spring water. My name is Jean-Francois. - Look at your eyes. - What about my eyes? - Your jaw's flapping. - So what? Your breasts flap too! Stop! I just wanted to hang out. But I couldn't find you. How come you gotta take shit to get off? It's a blast! You know, you're not fifteen any more. You can be so nice... so gentle. - Or such an ass! - Stop it! I wanna go home! I wanna go home and rest. I don't wanna stay here with you. You look like a ghost. - Stop it! - Stop, Alex. - I'll take you home. - Don't touch me! Alex! Alex! Alex. Come on. Alex! I said I'll take you home! I'll take you home! Alex! Fuck! Shut the door. - I'm going. - Where to? - I'm tired. - Tired? What? You were just dancing. What's going on? He's totally fucked up. Watch him. He doesn't need me. You need me. Don't worry, nothing'll happen. - I'll call you tomorrow. - Tomorrow? I came here to see you. I haven't seen you in months. I need an excuse just to look in your eyes and watch you dance. - Don't hurt yourself. - It doesn't hurt. I like seeing you. It's an aesthetic pleasure. A bit of nostalgia, that's all. Don't go, don't go! I'll call you tomorrow. - What for? - You're so cute. No, I'm not. Don't go alone. It's not safe. I'm reading an amazing book. - How many months? - Several. I can't finish it. What I'm telling you is special. She turns a page and... slam! - What is it? - It says... The book says that... It says the future is already written. It's all there."

Oh, really? Aren't we great the two of us! When the two of us are together Oh, how life is such a wonder! When the two of us are one We could fly to outer space When my heart is next to yours I love you. Me too. We love each other forever And even if there were no ever We'd love each other all the same What if I'm pregnant? That'd be fun! Oh yes, please! Shower. Gotta get some booze! - You got any cash? - You stop it! - Stop what? - You never have any money! You're impossible! Right, but do you? I'll take it from your purse. Be right back.
