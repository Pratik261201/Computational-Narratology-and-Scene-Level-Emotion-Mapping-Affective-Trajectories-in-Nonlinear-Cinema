Can I ask you something? Can I join you? It's a free country. Whoa. Would that were true, kid. Would that were true. The name is Jack, Pappy Jack. And I can be the best goddamn pappy you ever had. I already got one. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. You threw a hell of a punch out there. Tell me. Do you fight? Do you box? Golden Gloves, over in Bridgeport. Did you win? Yeah. It was like five, six bouts. You want something else? Apple pie? I don't know. Maybe-- Maybe later. How about you? A little privacy, please? Thank you. Thank you very much. We have these amateur bouts every Friday night. Some smokers. Nothing special, fancy-schmantzy. But there's a lot of bucks involved. You fight a few rounds for me tomorrow night, I'll make it worth your while. How much worth my while? Oh, now we're talking. Now we're doing business. $750 bucks worth your while. You'd pay me $750 to fight tomorrow night? What is there, a fucking echo in here? Who do I fight? A guy named... Black Death. But don't worry. He's not a fatal disease. And anyway, you got the antidote. There's a lot of tough kids around here. They don't have the right... complexion. I lost my white kid. My back's on the wall. No, thanks. No, thanks? Hey, how many dishes do you have to wash for $750 bucks? About 30,528. Thirty-thousand five-- So, what are you? An idiot? I need 1250 bucks. You're negotiating with me? That's what I need to clear up a few debts, that's all. I don't wanna hear any hard luck stories. Do you wanna fight or don't you? Don't get a hard-on! Are we negotiating or aren't we? Okay. I like you. I like the way you handle yourself. We're gonna do it your way. Twelve-hundred fifty bucks. (CHUCKLING) (DOOR CLOSES) Dad? MAN: Tommy. Tommy? Tommy? Tommy, wake up. I got some great news. Hey, Dad. You know that job I've been telling you about? I got it. Starting today I'm on the Phillip's payroll. That's great. Yeah, that's great. The bad part is, I gotta be in Elgin at 10:00, and after that I gotta go out on the road for the next month. A month? Selling medical supplies. I learn the territory, then they bring me back. I work full-time in Chicago.",

Can I join you? It's a free country. Whoa. Would that were true, kid. Would that were true. The name is Jack, Pappy Jack. And I can be the best goddamn pappy you ever had. I already got one.  Yeah. You threw a hell of a punch out there. Tell me. Do you fight? Do you box? Golden Gloves, over in Bridgeport. Did you win? Yeah. It was like five, six bouts. You want something else? Apple pie? I don't know. Maybe-- Maybe later. How about you? A little privacy, please? Thank you. Thank you very much. We have these amateur bouts every Friday night. Some smokers. Nothing special, fancy-schmantzy. But there's a lot of bucks involved. You fight a few rounds for me tomorrow night, I'll make it worth your while. How much worth my while? Oh, now we're talking. Now we're doing business. $750 bucks worth your while. You'd pay me $750 to fight tomorrow night? What is there, a fucking echo in here? Who do I fight? A guy named... Black Death. But don't worry. He's not a fatal disease. And anyway, you got the antidote. There's a lot of tough kids around here. They don't have the right... complexion. I lost my white kid. My back's on the wall. No, thanks. No, thanks? Hey, how many dishes do you have to wash for $750 bucks? About 30,528. Thirty-thousand five-- So, what are you? An idiot? I need 1250 bucks. You're negotiating with me? That's what I need to clear up a few debts, that's all. I don't wanna hear any hard luck stories. Do you wanna fight or don't you? Don't get a hard-on! Are we negotiating or aren't we? Okay. I like you. I like the way you handle yourself. We're gonna do it your way. Twelve-hundred fifty bucks.   Dad? MAN: Tommy. Tommy? Tommy? Tommy, wake up. I got some great news. Hey, Dad. You know that job I've been telling you about? I got it. Starting today I'm on the Phillip's payroll. That's great. Yeah, that's great. The bad part is, I gotta be in Elgin at 10:00, and after that I gotta go out on the road for the next month. A month? Selling medical supplies. I learn the territory, then they bring me back. I work full-time in Chicago."

Well, what was that Friday night, a ghost? Let me tell you something. Some ghost look just like you wasted Black Death. That's Lincoln.  You, uh, looking for something, chief? Pappy Jack. In his office. All right. From Horn. And this one's from me. Say hello to Mike.  Hey, kid!"

You know, Tommy, I should be upset with you. Why? You cost me my investment. What's that mean? It means Black Death is damaged goods, kid. So now I'm invested in you, huh? How would you like to fight for me, Tommy? I appreciate the offer, Mr. Horn, but I'm not interested. Come on, kid. If it's a matter of money... No, no. You know, it's not the money.

That's why they invented boxing gloves. Stay away, kid! Move! Say good night, kid. Where you gonna go now? You better try something. That ain't gonna do it. Come on! That ain't good enough. Break! Break! Break! Come on, go to sleep. Go to sleep. That's it.  One. Two. Get up! Three. Four. Five. Come on, kid. Six. Seven. You can make it. Eight. Nine.  One. Two. Three. Stay down, kid. Four.
