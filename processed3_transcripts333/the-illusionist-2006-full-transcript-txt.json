I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovicz... Also known as Eisenheim the Illusionist... on charges of disturbing public order... Charlatanism and threats against the empire! Leave him alone! They're arresting him! They're arresting Eisenheim! Chief Inspector Uhl. - You're late. - My apologies, Your Highness. I was attending to the loose ends of the case. - Are there still loose ends? - Very few. Did he do it again? How does he do it? I'm afraid I still don't know. Did you ask him? He's not talking at this point. Well, I'm sure you have... methods... for that kind of thing. I want you to put an end to it. Surely you have something on him. Something from his past? Yes. Yes, I think I do. In fact, we know all about his life. We've spoken to almost everyone who ever knew him. As a boy, I'm told he had a chance encounter... with a traveling magician. Boy. One version of the story was that the man himself... then vanished... along with the tree. Who knows what actually happened? People began to think he had some kind of special power... or at least that he was a bit different. And then he met her. - Don't drop it. - Careful, you're going to trip. - Drop it, you muck snipe. - Oh! Watch out for that hole, alley rat! - Drop it! - Come on. Pick a card. Put it back in the deck. Now, watch. Duchess von Teschen, you can't be in a place like this. They're peasants. Remember who you are. She was brought back to the castle... and they were forbidden to see each other. But soon, they were doing just that. Over the next few years, they could always find a way to be together. Quick, come on. In China there's a magician that could make anything disappear- a house, a wagon, anything. We'll go visit him. They can't stop us if we want to be together. They'll never find us. Do you promise you'll take me with you? One day I will. One day we'll run away together. We'll disappear. There's a secret way to open it. I wanted a picture. Sophie, are you there? - We must hurry! They're coming! - Duchess von Teschen! Duchess von Teschen! - Duchess von Teschen! - Duchess von Teschen! Make us disappear. Make us disappear.",

Have we not each experienced the sensation... that a beautiful moment seemed to pass too quickly... and wished that we could make it linger? Or felt time slow on a dull day... and wished that we could speed things up a bit? I assure you, they're quite real. Is it real? Let's see. And you, madam, where is your handkerchief? Bravo! Very good. Give us something, please. - Please, give us something. Please. - What's all this? We're poor. - Do you think you're poor? - Yes. I want to show you something. You're not poor. You have everything that you need right here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And that's yours. And this too. I've got the magic one! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Coffee? - No. - Strudel?

All of the greatest religions... speak of the soul's endurance beyond the end of life. So, what then does it mean... to die? I need a volunteer from the audience. Someone not afraid of death. Please, someone? I assure you, no tragedy will befall you. It's an honor, Duchess von Teschen. Do you know me? No. You're quite certain that we've never met before? Yes, of course. Now please gaze directly into my eyes. Look nowhere else. Wave to yourself. Turn in a circle. Now bow to yourself. Away. They must have liked you. They've waited for you nearly five minutes. Your Highness, may I introduce Eisenheim the Illusionist? - Well done. - Thank you for coming. I hope you enjoyed it. Oh, we more than enjoyed it. Stimulated great debate amongst us, hasn't it? Except of course for your assistant, Duchess von Teschen. You seemed to have struck her quite speechless. A feat in itself. - Did you hypnotize her? - In a fashion. I'd like to learn that trick. Rainier here thinks you have supernatural powers. Do you claim supernatural powers? I've never said anything of that kind. - Then you won't mind a question or two. - Now let's not ruin it. You needn't divulge anything I can't guess. As you wish. Your assistants are behind the mirror... somewhere in robes obviously. Lights in the frame perhaps to illuminate them, or angled mirrors? That would be one way to do it. I think I understand it all except the ghost. That was very, very good. Another viewing perhaps? You must come to the Hofburg next time. We'll make an evening of it. That will be my pleasure. So be it. Sophie? And we'll gather our best minds next time. You'll really have a challenge then. Then I'll prepare something special. Perhaps I'll make you disappear. My God. When he volunteered her... I heard the crashing sound of money falling on me in piles. Every lady of means in Vienna will want to get up there with you now. - Mmm. - What a show-off. His father would have died if he had seen such a display. - She didn't seem too happy about it either. - She'd better get used to it. - How's that? - Word is she'll marry him soon. - Really? - Taking her chances if you ask me.",

Except of course for your assistant, Duchess von Teschen. You seemed to have struck her quite speechless. A feat in itself. - Did you hypnotize her? - In a fashion. I'd like to learn that trick. Rainier here thinks you have supernatural powers. Do you claim supernatural powers? I've never said anything of that kind. - Then you won't mind a question or two. - Now let's not ruin it. You needn't divulge anything I can't guess. As you wish. Your assistants are behind the mirror... somewhere in robes obviously. Lights in the frame perhaps to illuminate them, or angled mirrors? That would be one way to do it. I think I understand it all except the ghost. That was very, very good. Another viewing perhaps? You must come to the Hofburg next time. We'll make an evening of it. That will be my pleasure. So be it. Sophie? And we'll gather our best minds next time. You'll really have a challenge then. Then I'll prepare something special. Perhaps I'll make you disappear. My God. When he volunteered her... I heard the crashing sound of money falling on me in piles. Every lady of means in Vienna will want to get up there with you now. - Mmm. - What a show-off. His father would have died if he had seen such a display. - She didn't seem too happy about it either. - She'd better get used to it. - How's that? - Word is she'll marry him soon. - Really? - Taking her chances if you ask me."

He only gets Hungary by aligning himself with my family. - Leave him. - It's not that easy. Call it off and come away with me. Or don't say anything and we'll just go. As long as we're alive... he'll hunt us. And when he finds us, he'll kill us. Look at me. Do you truly want to leave with me? Yes, I do. There you are. As I predicted, they've shut us down. Are you happy now, hmm? You made your point. It doesn't matter that we were sold out for the whole run! No, look. You got it off your chest. - Do we have money? - What? - Do we have any money saved? - Yes, we have some. But we could have had much, much more. Mmm, it will have to do. And the second account, all of it. Of course, Herr Eisenheim. Thank you. And you have no doubt it was Duchess von Teschen? I'd stake my life on it. What was in this suitcase? I don't know. He's by the first car. The map will show you where to meet. When it's done, you'll travel ahead with her and I shall follow. And she understands everything this entails? Completely. There's not a lot of time. As you know, we sometimes follow... Duchess von Teschen for her protection. Yesterday she was seen in the company of another man. What man? Eisenheim the Illusionist. What were they doing? - Well, they were meeting and, uh- - Touching? Kissing? Fornicating? Not that we observed, no. However, I have reason to believe that they may be planning something together. It's possible they may be leaving. I'm not certain of anything yet, Your Highness. Thank you, Inspector. We can, of course, acquire more information- He spent the afternoon in Vienna with his father. He's expected shortly. What a surprise. I thought you didn't like it here. I suppose you think you're very clever... and very democratic in your friendships. - Aren't you? - What are you talking about? Your magician friend. I know you've been with him. It's true. We've been friends since childhood. You sleep with all your childhood friends? I will not be spoken to this way. - You'll be spoken to as I wish to speak to you! - You're drunk. You're getting quite old, aren't you? You know, my mother was 16 years old when she married my father. And you? Can you even bear children?",

This is just a rough demonstration, Inspector. But you can see how it could work. Yes, I see. Not bad, not bad. We need a spy in Eisenheim's troupe. - Those Orientals, they won't give us anything. - Mm. - I already tried. - Yeah. Then try something else. What has happened here? One of those ghosts from the theater down the street. - Yes. Up there. - Where? - There. - Right there. And it's a boy. - Yes. Look, look. - Sick! - Where is this thing? - Right there. - Over there. - Uh-huh. Did you see it? Mm! God. An apparition. I saw it. I swear. - Yes! - Right over there. Where are you taking him? I want to know how it's done. First the orange tree, now this. Do I have to share all my professional secrets with the police? Well, in this case, yes, or I'll be forced to arrest you. - On what charge? - Oh, well, we'll start with fraud. - Excuse me, Chief Inspector- - What?

What do your spies tell you? That you plan to subvert the monarchy, perhaps. Why? Just because the crown prince is a murderer? He's not a murderer. We have the real murderer in prison. - He pleaded guilty. - You've got the wrong man. - You don't know that. - No, but you do. Hmm. Herr Eisenheim, you will also go to prison... if you don't explain to me what it is you are doing. - Let him go! - Or we will! The sentence will be greater if that mob attacks the building. Eisenheim! Eisenheim! Eisenheim! Well? What are you doing? Stop! - Stop! - Eisenheim! There he is! Listen to me, please! You must listen to me, please! Thank you all for coming. I have been speaking with the chief inspector. And I think there's been a serious misunderstanding. I want you all to know... that everything that you have seen in my theater is an illusion. It's a trick. It's not real. I can't bring loved ones back from the grave. I can't receive messages from the other side.",

        "Why must I be bothered with a magician? He is proving to be more than a magician, Your Highness. He is a charlatan. He's a faker. He pretends to have supernatural powers- Put him on trial for fraud. - First, we have to show it is fraud. - Then do it. Find out how the trick is done, and then arrest him. This is just a rough demonstration, Inspector. But you can see how it could work. Yes, I see. Not bad, not bad. We need a spy in Eisenheim's troupe. - Those Orientals, they won't give us anything. - Mm. - I already tried. - Yeah. Then try something else. What has happened here? One of those ghosts from the theater down the street. - Yes. Up there. - Where? - There. - Right there. And it's a boy. - Yes. Look, look. - Sick! - Where is this thing? - Right there. - Over there. - Uh-huh. Did you see it? Mm! God. An apparition. I saw it. I swear. - Yes! - Right over there. Where are you taking him? I want to know how it's done. First the orange tree, now this. Do I have to share all my professional secrets with the police? Well, in this case, yes, or I'll be forced to arrest you. - On what charge? - Oh, well, we'll start with fraud. - Excuse me, Chief Inspector- - What?
