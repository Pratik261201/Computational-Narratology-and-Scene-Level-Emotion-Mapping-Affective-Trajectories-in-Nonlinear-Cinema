'Cause I got to throw you a curveball every now and then or you get bored, and then the mix doesn't have its intended effect. No, I want to get revved up, and this song's not doing it. Oh, really? I defy you to crush this chorus and not get psyched. Not going to happen. What is it? Help me out! He was afraid. - Bring it home. - Oh, yeah. Come on, papi. Yes! We've got our jam on now. - Jump to it. It's been a dry June, and I know it doesn't need to be said out loud, but we need this sale. - I am so confident that we're going to close this thing that I'm going to order the Pappy Van Winkle. I know it's pricey, but I want to spiritually invest in our success. I'll tell you what, if you didn't order the Pappy, I'd send your raggedy ass back out to the car to listen to the get-psyched mix to get your mind right. We're selling Bob Williams. Been married 16 years. Wife Karen, one daughter. You read the first page of the scouting report. Let me hip you to page two. Daughter's name is Skyler, big into gymnastics. And to hear Bob tell it, the kid is aces on the pommel horse. He don't just tell it, old boy. He likes to show it with pictures. Everyone's searching for something. Am I right, Bob? Love. Success. But what's the one thing that no one can get more of? Time. Mmm. And you can't fight it. Well, you don't have to tell me. I mean, look at my little girl. How old is Skyler nowadays, Bob? Just turned nine in May. - Nine? Isn't that something? - She just turned nine. Skyler's nine? - Mmm. Good Lord. How old does that make all of us? Don't answer that question, Bob. Let's move on. - I was about... I was about to answer. Pretty soon, she's going to be borrowing Karen's makeup, and you're going to have two beauties on your hands. Lock the door. It's coming, Bob. Double digits. - No way. Is Skyler still giving them hell on that pommel horse? You want to see that photo? - If it's not too much trouble. Yeah, let me show you Sky, yeah. Let's get those eyes on Skyler. - Look at her. Yeah... yeah, she's really sprouted. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Skyler's really slimming down. And I'll tell you what. Gorgeous. - She's eating really healthy. Just mostly fruits and nuts. Her choice. - There is no telling what this little girl on a squirrel diet could end up doing.",

Clickety-clack, clickety-clack, she's married. Clickety-clack, she's putting you in a home! Oh, my God, a home. She would do it, too. I believe that, too. - No, no, she would.

Carpe diem. These babies will fly off your shelf. Now, I know that you've moved up to having six stores, so you're probably going to want to have a little larger order than you did last year. You're kidding, right? Your... your business has... been folded. I'm sorry? - No, no, no, no, Bob, there has been some chatter. The last few years have been rough. But come on, who hasn't felt the pinch? Yeah. They didn't tell you, did they? Look... I thought you guys just wanted to grab dinner for old times' sake, but, uh... - Yeah. Your company is closed. I hate to be the one telling you that. Honestly, I know that I can't buy the watches because your company doesn't exist anymore, but I wish I could. I mean, that's how good you guys are. One round of Pappy Van Winkle. Enjoy, gentlemen. Oh... wow. That is expensive stuff. You know, Bob, uh... do you mind, uh... just going Dutch? - You don't have to say any more. I got it. I'm doing this. Let me do this. I'm saying let's slice the pie three ways, honestly. If you don't mind. - No, that-that-that's silly. That's silly. I'm doing really, really... really well right now, and you guys are not. But, Bob, I can... - At all. Let me do this. But let's just split it. Let's go Dutch. Okay. Okay. - Let's be the three Dutchmen. Okay, but this Dutchman's going to... going to pay when he can in a couple weeks. I hope you understand. What the fuck, Sammy? What the fuck, me? What the fuck, you? Who told you you could barge into my office without an appointment? You closed the company? And then you send us out on a sale that we really needed and had Bob Williams drop that bomb on us?",

      "raw_text": "Okay, listen. That could've been avoided if the Bob Williams deal didn't go so bad on me. You blew the Bob Williams deal? - Well, it's not so much that I blew the deal as much as the company just decided to shut down and take our jobs away. What? - Come on, listen to me, sweetheart. I promise you, I can pay for all of this. It's not about the money, Billy. This is about you, okay? You-you talk a big game, but you never do anything about it. It's like you say that we're going to go to Spain, but have I ever been to Barcelona? - \"Barthelona.\" Ugh. - And not yet, but we're going. Vaya con dios, mi amor. What? - Porque esta bravo en Barthelona y fant?stico. No, we are not going to \"Barthelona,\" okay? We have discussed going to Barthelona, but we are never going to go to Barthelona. Not with an attitude like that, we're not. - Oh, God. Wait, do you even hear yourself? Yes. - I'm glad that you got to say some of that, because we're in a relationship, and I'm just glad that we're both committed to it. No... do you know how badly I want to believe that, Billy? Because I've been with you for a long time, and nothing ever seems to get better. Honey, you were... you're such a great guy, but you always figure out a way to screw things up and let people down. And, Billy, I love you, but I'm really tired of being let down. That's terrible, Nicky. Are you okay? I should have gone on my own when I had the chance. I was so stupid. I was... Nicky, you did the right thing. Always got a paycheck, played it smart. Dad would have been proud. Well, what would he have been proud of? I didn't play it smart. I played it safe. And look where I am now. Proud? You're at your nephew's Little League game. Now, cheer up. Okay. - Come on. All right, Tate! - All right, here we go, Tate. Put some wood on it. He's a great kid. I keep telling you you'd make a terrific father. Yep, you do keep telling me that. Unfortunately, it would require you having a relationship that lasted longer than three months. I'm not sure it would require that. Let me call Kevin. - Jeanie... I'm sure your boyfriend's a great guy, but I'm not ready to work for someone who spent all of last Thanksgiving explaining the meaning of his tattoo. Be reasonable, Nicky. Take the job.

        "Okay, listen. That could've been avoided if the Bob Williams deal didn't go so bad on me. You blew the Bob Williams deal? - Well, it's not so much that I blew the deal as much as the company just decided to shut down and take our jobs away. What? - Come on, listen to me, sweetheart. I promise you, I can pay for all of this. It's not about the money, Billy. This is about you, okay? You-you talk a big game, but you never do anything about it. It's like you say that we're going to go to Spain, but have I ever been to Barcelona? - \"Barthelona.\" Ugh. - And not yet, but we're going. Vaya con dios, mi amor. What? - Porque esta bravo en Barthelona y fant?stico. No, we are not going to \"Barthelona,\" okay? We have discussed going to Barthelona, but we are never going to go to Barthelona. Not with an attitude like that, we're not. - Oh, God. Wait, do you even hear yourself? Yes. - I'm glad that you got to say some of that, because we're in a relationship, and I'm just glad that we're both committed to it. No... do you know how badly I want to believe that, Billy? Because I've been with you for a long time, and nothing ever seems to get better. Honey, you were... you're such a great guy, but you always figure out a way to screw things up and let people down. And, Billy, I love you, but I'm really tired of being let down. That's terrible, Nicky. Are you okay? I should have gone on my own when I had the chance. I was so stupid. I was... Nicky, you did the right thing. Always got a paycheck, played it smart. Dad would have been proud. Well, what would he have been proud of? I didn't play it smart. I played it safe. And look where I am now. Proud? You're at your nephew's Little League game. Now, cheer up. Okay. - Come on. All right, Tate! - All right, here we go, Tate. Put some wood on it. He's a great kid. I keep telling you you'd make a terrific father. Yep, you do keep telling me that. Unfortunately, it would require you having a relationship that lasted longer than three months.

Uh-huh. And what we're gonna do is separate the feet, create a little heat dispersion. Excuse me! - Now, so we have... Is there something I can help you with, ma'am?! What?! I'm trying to buy a mattress. Unbelievable! Listen, our interview is in one hour. Now, Nick, this might be the last chance that we got. How's it going, Gossip Girls? CW just called; You're canceled. Excuse me? Look, I know you're peddling him a bunch of crap, just like the crap merchandise you two used to shill. So, listen up, Marfan Syndrome."

Or maybe you stick us in those submarines that they put in people's bodies to fight diseases. That's cutting-edge right there. Okay, you... That's-that's not a real thing, the submarines. - No. Wait a minute. I thought we were stuck in a blender. Now we're saving lives? What?! Uh, what? - What? - What?! - What?! - What? Let me just recap this for you real quick. We started off in a blend... - Yeah. Now we're saving lives! - What?! - What?! - What? What? - What? - Wait a minute! We were stuck in a blender... - What a journey! And now we saving lives?! What?! - You guys led us to this. Thank you. I think we've gotten a little far afield. Just a little off topic. Ally, I'll get inside you and I'll fight for you. Uh, thank you. I-I appreciate that, but... Which one of you... which one of you is physics? Mr. Campbell? You could maybe expound on this from a physics aspect. Physics. Here, here... Listen, the... I-I could bend your ear about physics and various physical phenomenon, but the truth is, we were in a blender. We lost our jobs, we'd given up. So I think we already answered the question when we took this interview. We got ourselves out, and here we are. If you guys really want to know what happens when you take two guys out of a blender... I'm sorry, Allison, is it? Yes. Then give us a shot. And I think you'd be happy that you did. So, who is our next applicant? Ah, our two daiquiri men. So, what are we thinking... Dana? You're kidding, right? No. Eleanor? Mmm, they seem like really nice guys, but I-I don't think so. - Okay. Moving on. Oh, can I say something? You can. You will. We will resent you for wasting our time, but please don't let that stop you. It's just, diversity is in our DNA, right? I thought the goal here was to find people with a different way of thinking. There's plenty of people with a different way of thinking. It doesn't mean that we have to hire them. Very good point, Dana. Moving on. I'm sorry, but you read their r?sum?s, right? They have more years of sales and life experience than the age of most of our interns. Not to mention, our final judgment is always based on the Layover Test, right? Who would you rather be stuck next to at an airport bar for a six-hour delay?",

You are going to raise the green paddle to indicate \"yes\" and the red paddle to indicate \"no.\" So, let's begin. \"Having a beer with your boss.\" Some of you are under 21. Some of us aren't under 21, so... if you want to grab a cold one with me, I'm happy to do that with you. I will not be grabbing a cold one with you. You get high? I don't get high. - Okay. I'm not judging; I'm just saying, people do it. That being said, if you want something cold to drink, we'll hook you up. I'm okay. Thank you; Just stop talking to me. I'm your Bill Holden in Stalag 17. I don't even... I really don't get that reference. Google it. - Got it. \"Dating a fellow intern.\" Chetty, excuse me. What about a full-time employee? Say, management level, but not a direct supervisor. Great eyes, and a severity to her look that is surprisingly sexy. What's the policy on that? No? That's frowned upon also? So we'll say no to love? We'll say no to love, yes. That's gonna be a no. - Now, \"taking food home from the office.\" Boom. Yes. Are you having difficulty with this, Mr. McMahon? - I'm sorry.",

If it please the court. Oh, it pleases the court, counselor. Okay, Workplace Seminar. Still a few seats left. First impression time, baby. Bingo! Okay, we can do good in this. We have to do... - Shazam! So close yet so far, boys. Whoa! Graham, Graham, we were here first. You know what? You're right. You guys could use the advantage. Go ahead. What's that supposed to mean? It means that in a world of excellence, old and unexceptional qualifies as diversity. So you know what? Go ahead. What's that saying? \"Age before beauty\"? Thank you. You're welcome, William.

The teat or baba thing, it's wrong. I just Googled it, so you're wrong. Oh, yeah, I'm Stuart. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Stu. You know, you can't trust everything you read on the... The Journal of the American Medical Association? Sounds pretty trustworthy. It says that breast milk has more nutrients and that those nutrients are more easily digested and absorbed. Your confusion is understandable, though. You were bottle-fed. He's right. That's right. Whoa, guys, where's all this hostility coming from? Where do you think it's coming from, you big tree?

Did you get beat up a lot in homeschool? Discipline is a very important part of growth. But my mother was actually a very nurturing person. For example, she provided me selflessly with the milk of her bosom until I was seven years old. So it's like, uh, you're tying your shoe, you're climbing trees, you're blowing up fireworks, and then you're right on Mom. You got mouth on Mom. Breast-feeding leads to a higher IQ. Okay. Actually, the science isn't quite definitive on that. I was bottle-fed. It never slowed me down. Vitamins are vitamins, whether they come from a teat or a baba. Wrong. Sorry, what was that? Wrong. The teat or baba thing, it's wrong. I just Googled it, so you're wrong. Oh, yeah, I'm Stuart. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Stu. You know, you can't trust everything you read on the... The Journal of the American Medical Association? Sounds pretty trustworthy. It says that breast milk has more nutrients and that those nutrients are more easily digested and absorbed. Your confusion is understandable, though. You were bottle-fed. He's right. That's right. Whoa, guys, where's all this hostility coming from? Where do you think it's coming from, you big tree? Two fifths of our team are made up of two old guys who don't know shit. Wow."

Yeah, thanks so much for that. That's, uh... really great team spirit. Mind sliding over here? I'm sorry. It really doesn't look like there's enough room for you. Have a great lunch. Yeah, enjoy it.

That is Instagram. That's Instagram. - Hundred percent. I get it. We're hip. - We're not dummies. Point taken. Now let's go with my concept. Now you've taken a photo instantaneously, or not instantaneously, and then you take those and you send those out on the line. Online. - You don't have to say shit. You don't. You just say, \"I like that photo,\" and you share that photo instantaneously on the line - Online. - With your friends. Now everyone's exchanging ideas. Everyone's exchanging photos! And that's why the photos that are being shared on the line... - Online. Will be known as \"Exchangeagram.\" Nice! - Holy shitballs, Billy! We don't have time for this. Hello, fellow interns! Graham Hawtrey here. I've taken the liberty of attaching a link to our app, which has already been downloaded 230 times. Booyah! Great. We're gonna lose yet another challenge, we're not gonna get these jobs, and our lives are basically ruined. Okay, hold on a sec. Your life isn't ruined. You guys are 21 years old. You have your whole life in front of you. Do you even know what it's like to be 21 right now? I mean, a quarter of the kids coming out of college can't even get jobs. That's a correct statistic. Mother says you can work hard and go to the right school, but nothing is guaranteed anymore."

And, uh... terrific shoes... I'm always excited to see what kind of getup you're gonna throw together. That part's true. - Well, it is true. A lot of great things going. Some guy's gonna find himself very lucky to be next to you. Yeah, I'm not so sure. Well, I am. And I've been around a little bit. I'm positive. Looks like you hit it off with Saffron tonight.

Please don't do that. You're drunk off your ass. I appreciate your concern, but I'm flying, baby. Okay, Lyle, you're not flying. What's 17 squared? 289. Why? Give me a harder question than that.

Hells, yeah, we could do that. - Are you shitting me? I could program the shit out of that bitch on the bus ride home. Well, I'll take that as an overwhelming yes, then! Come on! Let's roll! - Let's get back to HQ! - Hey, wait, wait. Let's-let's stay, like, five minutes, you know? Just enjoy the view a little more. All right. Yeah? Wow. Yeah. Oh, the whole world looks like a giant pinwheel of death right now. Price of making memories, Stewie. I think my liver hurts. Astonishingly, your app received ten times more downloads than any other team's. It appears that you have won your first challenge. How about it? - Congratulations. - Oh, yeah! Come on, baby. - The lead! Oh, easy there, big guy. He gets overexcited. Lovely. Let it out. Let it out, little feller. That's what I'm talking about. Right there! Yeah! Right there!

Mine wasn't clicking. Mine's gray. Is anyone else's gray? Did you not hear my opening remarks? Yeah, no, I heard most of your opening remarks. It's just, I was... I was getting in the zone. I was pre-gaming it. - I was very clear that you had to log into your account so that I could review your work later. Well, the good news is that you reviewed my work now. You-you don't need the instant replay because you saw the touchdown live, in person. I don't really understand that analogy, but I do know that attention to detail is of paramount importance here and my instructions were explicit. Now, if there's no recording, then it's as if you didn't even show up today. Except I did show up. I'm-I'm sitting right here, Chetty. Well, according to your log, you're not. And since every intern must complete the challenge in order for your team to be scored... your team will unfortunately receive a score of zero. Zero? Well done, Mr. McMahon. Perhaps more studying, less pudding. Hmm? - Chetty, come on. You're not going to trip us with a technicality. He's right here. Oh, Billy, Billy, Billy, what have you done? It's you lot I feel bad for. It's really hard to get here. Some of you are probably pretty intelligent. You deserve better. I'm sorry. It's all right, El Ni?o. We'll get 'em. I studied for the test. I studied for... Well, that's great. That's another win for Team Graham. There's only one challenge left. Even if we're perfect, it won't be enough. We had 'em, too. We did, but, you know, it's just a little hiccup, a little adversity, all right? No, Nick, come on. Face it. Look, Billy's a great guy and everything, but he kind of blew it for us today. Yeah, I know... The kids are right, Nick. I just wanted to... come by and let you guys know that I... I did study last night. I tried my best. It's just, uh, you know, today on the phones, I just... it's my fault. And, uh... He was right when he said that you guys deserve better."

What are you talking about, you fat... Man down! Chetty, I appreciate what you said back there. I know you had us figured wrong from the beginning. He voted for you from the beginning. What? Mr. Chetty was the deciding vote on the intern committee. I didn't have a fancy education like most of the people here. I had to work hard to get to where I am. And I recognized a similar tenacity in you two gentlemen, so I took a chance on you. You did test my faith a few times. Basically, the entire time. But I'm glad you proved me right. Chetty, thanks for betting on us. Good to see you. Hey. So it looks like you're gonna be seeing a lot more of me around here. So it does. Congratulations. Thank you. Look, the other night... It was fun. Yeah, it was fun. Right? Yeah. No regrets. No. All right, let's get to that warm, fuzzy part. Um, that's not going to happen. - God, I love him even more. He leaves it cold like that. You know what I mean? You keep playing hard to get, you're gonna find yourself all alone. We're not gonna have a beer together. We're gonna have about five of them. We're equals now, my friend. - No, we're not. Yes, we are. No, we're not. - Let's go pick out some other interns and shape some diamonds in the rough. Please stop following me. Please stop talking to me. We're gonna get drunk. Have a great senior year, guys. We'll keep your desk chairs warm for you. Team Lyle. Team Lyle! That's the spirit. Yo-Yo! Come. Now. Mom, I need a minute. Yo-Yo, I not go. We need to... - Mom. I'm saying good-bye to my friends. I'm taking a minute. Okay? Look who grew an eyebrow, Yo-Yo! Come on! All right, you riffraff, get out of here. See you down the road. - See you guys. See you, bud. - Thank you, Captain. Thank you, Big B. Bye, guys. My Khaleesi. - My sun and stars.",
