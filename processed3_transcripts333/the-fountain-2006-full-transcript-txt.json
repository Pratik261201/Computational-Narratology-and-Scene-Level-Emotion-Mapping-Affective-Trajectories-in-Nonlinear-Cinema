You hanging in? ANTONIO: No good. Great specificity, but no suppression. BETTY: Should we close him? HENRY: We'll have to euthanize. BETTY: Why?

HENRY: We see an increase in neural activity... throughout all the areas usually stunted by normal aging. (CHUCKLING) - And the tumor? - No change. The growth patterns are normal. There's no positive or negative effect. - BETTY: We should tell Dr. Guzetti right away. - No. No. Antonio... prep a new cocktail.
