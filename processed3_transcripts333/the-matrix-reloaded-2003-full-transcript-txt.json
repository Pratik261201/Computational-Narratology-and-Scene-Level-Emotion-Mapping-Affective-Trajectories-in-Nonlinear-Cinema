We're not there yet. Hello I am Ok Ju. This property has three buildings. The main house is an English style building, and the rest are Japanese style building that make up the living quarters. The Japanese architecture can't compare with the grandiose style of the English. The Mistress likes both Japanese and English architecture, that's why it's built this way. Besides this, there is another wing. The Mistress made a library there. Following, is the third building, servants' quarters. Since you are her personal maid, you will not be sleeping with the rest of the servants. You may eat the Mistress' leftover food. But the leftover tea must be brought to the kitchen. Left over oil and soap should be brought to the housekeeper. If you are caught stealing, you will be kicked out immediately. But, I believe you're not that kind of person Tamako. ah You will be called Tamako from now on. Leaning on Ok Ju I am Sasaki. Yes. The Miss' daily routine is simple. A walk in the backyard. Reciting poetry with the Master. Our Miss loves to read books the most compared to most rich people. And the richest among those who like to read. Even government officials come here. Bringing light to the name. You must be respectful. Occasionally, there are power outages but don't be afraid I'll be sleeping in here? Miss Hideko is very ill and is easily awakened. The Mistress' room is over there? Damn. Mother. Mother. Miss. Are you all right? Sun Ja. Is it you Sun Ja? Sun Ja got fired. I am the new maid. You were having a nightmare? See that cherry blossom tree over there? My Aunt went mad and hung herself on it. Occasionally, on dark nights her spirit can be seen. Just hanging there... Here. Drink this. My Aunt Gave a bit of alcohol to babies that woke up in the middle of the night Is this the scent of clothes? You think my actual name is Tamako... But my real name is Nam Sook Hee. Once I was born, I was given away to the silversmith shop of my father. ah, no, my mother's When I was 5, I could already tell the difference between fake and real money. Afterwards, I learned how to make fake signature stamps.",

I know Japanese and am experienced in being a maid. Fine, 50,000 accepted. Besides the jewelry and clothes, I want 10,000 on top of that. Is she crazy? Who's saying I'm crazy? It's not like that.

This place is somber, there's barely any sunlight. because Uncle won't permit it. Sunlight causes books to fade. You probably wouldn't like a dark and somber place like this. Do you not have any formality? I'll take my leave. I always get headaches when it's time for me to read. Help me read this. What? My goodness, thank you Lady Minami has praised me so well. Is that so? Miss you are Japanese. But why aren't you speaking Japanese? It's a bother. All the books Uncle makes me read are in Japanese. So help read it for me. Dear Miss Izumi Hideko, Count Fujiwara has informed me you are in need of a new maid. Maids are like spoons... an I mean... like chopsticks.... Or is it spoons? I don't know how to read, Miss. At all? What about the Korean alphabet? This is your name. Don't know your name either? You can learn the alphabet. You can even curse at me or steal things from me. But please don't lie to me. Understand? Yes, Mistress. It's my mother. What a very beautiful lady! What about me? Am I also beautiful? Everyone tells me I'm not as beautiful as my mother. I heard from Count Fujiwara...

Why does he think about it before sleeping? What happened to your feet? I don't have anywhere to go. When I moved to Korean when I was 5, I never left. But if you wear new shoes, the steps you take are all the same. These shoes seem to fit you. It's time for me to go practice. I'll go alone. What? It's still raining. At noon, come knock on the door. Understand? See you late- What are these? This is.... The former Mistress' house is so big. Why would she? Maybe the house was too big so she went insane? My new maid. Snake... Snake. Don't take another step. You need to remember. The snake is the limit. A snake. The Count? Today? So that's why you told me to go bathe. My aunt said when you hear that guests will come, drop everything and go bathe the children. The guests like the smell of a clean baby. Miss, you are my baby. My aunt also said, give the babies candy when they bathe. To teach them that bath time is sweet. What's wrong? One of my teeth is sharp. It keeps cutting me. Ah So this was the scent. It's smooth now. Hurry. Hurry. Welcome. Inviting me to the living room immediately as I arrive this is really too cordial Due to traveling I dressed comfortably. But don't worry, during our painting lessons, I will dress properly. Are you Tamako? Yes Count, please take good care of me. It'll be hard for me to deal with you if you disservice me. Understand? For a Korean you don't look so bad. So... Will you fulfill your duty? Count Fujiwara calls for your maid Tamako to help him do something. He asks you if it is alright? You were looking for me, Count? Come in. People back home miss you a lot. Saying Sook-Hee will become a better conman than her mother. Who'd believe words from a lying conman like you? It seems you and I have gotten closer, so whenever I make a move come meet me separately Understand? The Mistress is so naive, if someone were to pull her nipple she wouldn't even know it. Which is why you're at her side to help. You need to remind that this is for me. \"Ever since the Count's arrival your toenails have grown long so fast.\" Talk and use those sorts of methods ok?",

For a Korean you don't look so bad. So... Will you fulfill your duty? Count Fujiwara calls for your maid Tamako to help him do something. He asks you if it is alright? You were looking for me, Count? Come in. People back home miss you a lot. Saying Sook-Hee will become a better conman than her mother. Who'd believe words from a lying conman like you? It seems you and I have gotten closer, so whenever I make a move come meet me separately Understand? The Mistress is so naive, if someone were to pull her nipple she wouldn't even know it. Which is why you're at her side to help. You need to remind that this is for me. \"Ever since the Count's arrival your toenails have grown long so fast.\" Talk and use those sorts of methods ok?"

Think of your people. Looking after the children, growing older by the day. If you fail, they'll be extremely disappointed. Do you want to be like your mother? Don't you have to find money to take care of them? From here on, don't you dare touch Hideko. She doesn't know anything that goes on between man and woman. If she get's scared, you'll never get your chance. And also, stop shoving things... so small like that... into my hands. Hey. Ever since the Count came, your toenails have grown fast.

You shift and sigh when you sleep. And your toenails... Even though I don't consider that as love... I love someone else, not him... You've never felt that someone as dependent as me.... would marry him and be happy? You'll definitely fall in love with him. Mistress.

The day Uncle left, Count also made a ruse, pretending to go back to Japan. But in reality, hid somewhere near. You have a week of freedom. But you must remember the thing in the cellar. Miss. We are very honored to have you pick our boat. We should arrive around... 7:30 pm. At last have reach home. It's been 3 years, I miss it so much. Sorry. You may not steal. You may not steal.

The same authour as \"Lizard Tongue\" It is a Japanese person. I bought this from a Japanese library. Let this be tired in this world all over the place wandering the fellow. A traveler that always had people by his side. You get what I mean right? I love books such as this The final page is very amazing illustration But as you all see it's a real pity If the last page was intact it would've been splendid. If it were so, I would've gone all out for it. Just relying on words... is very difficult to truly depict the story. That's why illustrations were included in the first place. Then... we will have a live demonstration before the auction starts... Hideko. So beautiful. Please come again. Thank you. Today was outstanding. Thank you. Especially the endscene With such aristocrats... Why? Is it possible to imitate other's paintings? I believe in my craftsmanship. I'm very good at these types of things. Often pouring wine for women around me. To create a happy vibe. Even an expert wouldn't be able to tell. The Mistress of this house... can she get near you, Count? I am able to look into a woman's eyes. Only her eyes. And she will try to dodge my glare. But will immediately turn back and look. If it were tonight. I'd sneak into their blanket... The Miss here would scold and reject me..."

I dare say, the most amazing parts have never been written down in any book It feels like I'm listening to the singing of a child Then there were drops of crimson blood dripping down. From that, she became a blossomed woman. She once was a naive little girl, but now she has guts. What is this, naive, guts eh? Tell me, the essence, the process, You understand right? Did she resist? Did you squeeze her ass? Or swear at her? If you didn't then you should have. Now she is a widow. Hideko is my wife. There's no one else who can tell about the sexual experience with her. But at this damp and somber place, you've become an obscure lunatic. The toxicity in the smoke is very strong, only 1 cigarette is enough. Even like this, dying is a luxury."
