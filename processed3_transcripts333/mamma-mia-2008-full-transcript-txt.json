You know, I have no clue which one of you is my dad, but I don’t mind. Now, I know what I really want. Sky, let’s just not get married yet. - What? - What? You never wanted this anyway. I know that.

        "Why didn’t you call me? Because I was crazy enough to think that you would be waiting for me. Only when I arrived, they told me you were off with some other guy. So, Lorraine called me an idiot and married me to prove it. Sorry, can I just... Might I just butt in? DONNA: Oh, Harry, don’t... It’s all right. You don’t have to. No, no, I just wanted to say it’s great to have even a third of Sophie. I never thought I’d get even that much of a child. Donna, you were the first girl I ever loved. Well, actually, you were the last girl I ever loved. Now, this gives me an excuse to come here much more often. We can find out if you want, but I’m with Harry. Being a third of your dad is great by me. BILL: By me, too. I’ll take a third. Typical, isn’t it? You wait 20 years for a dad, and then three come along at once. Dearly beloved... You know, I have no clue which one of you is my dad, but I don’t mind. Now, I know what I really want. Sky, let’s just not get married yet. - What? - What? You never wanted this anyway. I know that. Let’s just get off this island and just see the world. Okay? All right? I love you."
