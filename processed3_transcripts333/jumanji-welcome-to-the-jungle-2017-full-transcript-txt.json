Mom, what did we say about the knocking? I'm late for work. Are you going to your father's after school? Yeah, probably. Don't forget your EpiPen. And pease, remember, the world is a terrifying place. Be careful of everything. I love you more than life itself. Bye. See you Sunday night. Ok. Later, Mama. Eat something before you go. I can't. I gotta go meet Spencer. Spencer Gilpin? Yeah, Spencer Gilpin. He's been tutoring me. He... He's helping me get my grades up. I love to hear that. Little Spencer Gilpin. Yeah. Your grades gonna be Ok? Yeah, that's why I'm getting help. I'd hate for you to get dropped from the team. I'm not gonna get dropped from the team. It's... It's gonna be fine. Ok? Ok. That's cute, right? Yeah. Yo. Hey, Fridge. Why you wearing a raincoat? What do you mean? I mean, it's not raining. Well, it might. I mean, you never know what's gonna happen. Oy vey. What the hell, man? Do you mind? Can we just speed this up? Freak House makes me, very uncomfortable. Here you go. You proofread everything? Yeah, I proofed it. And I gave it a beginning and... and an ending... and some in the middle. Look man, I would've done it myself, you know friend, if I had the time or whatever but... Yeah, it's no big deal. Hey man, I was thinking so... I mean, it's been really fun doing your papers and your homework and stuff but... I don't know what you're doing this weekend but I was maybe we could... This weekend. Yeah. Hey, Fridge. Hey. You need a ride? I'm going with her. You know what? That's actually better for me, scheduling-wise, too, so... See you later, Refrigerator. Sorry. Sorry. What up, girl? Whatever. It's not like I was your best friend, for your entire childhood. That's fine. What'd you say? Nothing, sir. Oh, that guy is super weird. That poor man. So awful what happened to those people. I was talking about the kid. What are you doing out here? I was just talking to my friend. You should be more careful where you loiter, you hear me?",

Bethany, did you just make a call during the quiz? Yeah. But I finished my quiz already. Oh, Ok. Well, have you noticed that other people haven't? So? I'm sorry. Let me back up. You're aware there are other people in the world, right? Look... you know, I'm dealing with something right now and... Trustme I'm no happier about it than you are. I'm having a crisis, and Lucinda, I mean, she's supporting me as a woman, and it feels like maybe you should too. Just hang up the phone. Ok, I'll wrap it up. Bethany, hang it up now. Two minutes and we're done. And that's detention. All right, keep those arms pumping. Let's go! Bethany, you're late. Sorry. I heard she broke up with that football guy. This could be your opening, Fussfeld. All right, we're gonna practice catching and throwing. So partner up and grab a football. Let's move! Hey, Martha. Martha. You can't play catch by yourself. Pair up. Come on. Let's go. No. No, I'm good. Ok. You have to participate just like everybody else. Otherwise, why are you even here? It's a requirement. Martha... I think it's pointless. Gym class is not gonna get me into Princeton and I don't understand the obsession with throwing a ball into a hoop and Touchdown, five points! Ok. There's a lot wrong with that, but first of all. It's physical activity, which is good for you. With other people, also good for you. And if you try it, you might even have some fun. Fun. That's what we're doing here? Fun? This is school. We are supposed to be learning things that actually matter. Ok, Martha... We don't have a lot of time in this life, and I personally don't wanna waste it on being, like, a... gym teacher. That. That. That came out wrong. Yeah, it sure did. That's detention. That was hard-core. Badass. Spencer Gilpin? Have a seat, Spencer. Miss Mathers?

And, coincidentally, it's the last sentence of your paper on westward expansion from last year. That's interesting. Is it? I think so. I mean, what are the odds of that? Slim. Yeah, you also used the same metaphor the spreading wildfire in your papers on the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Gettysburg and the women's suffrage movement. It's so hot in this room. Anthony, I know how much you need to pass my class but this is not how you're gonna do it. I will not tolerate cheating. Cheating? I didn't. I didn't. I didn't cheat. It was my fault. I made him do it. You made him... have you write his paper? Yeah. Look. I'm sorry, Ok? No, no, it's not Ok. What the hell, man? You got me kicked off the team. You could've gotten me expelled. It's not like you're the only one who's living dangerously here. Living dangerously? Yes. This is the most dangerous thing I've ever done in my life. And now look at me. I'm paying the price. Well... isn't this a fun group? Welcome to detention. Yes, Spencer? I wanna say that I'm sorry. Thank you. Principal Bentley, all I did was make one... Bethany, please. You're all here for a reason. You know what it is. But this is what you should be thinking about: Who you are... in this moment in time, and who you want to be. You get one life. You decide how you're gonna spend it. Fortunately, there is no better place for self-reflection, than detention. Get up, everybody. Let's go. We are turning this into a new computer center. But before we do, it has to be cleaned out. These old magazines are bound for the recycling plant. But they have to be prepped before they go. It seems all the staples must be removed. Whatever you don't finish today, you finish tomorrow. Tomorrow's Saturday. Because I wouldn't play football? I don't think that'll work. That's fair. Shut up. So I suggest you get started. Choose your weapons. Hey, what the hell they need with a bowling ball? Seriously, no reception? Ok, can today get any worse? Are you gonna help? Or are you too pretty? I'm too pretty. Hey. I was watching you with Coach Web today. I ean I wasn't watching you, I wasn't... Not, like, in a weird way. I just... I was in the room.",

Jumanji? What does that mean? I have no idea. Never heard of it. Which one do I pick? I don't know. I don't think it matters that much. Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough pilot and rascal. It's not working. Ok, try another one. Franklin 'Moose' Finbar. He sounds like a badass. And he's a zoology expert, which is awesome. You pick. Ok. Dr. Smolder Bravestone. Bethany, you in? Fine. I'll be... Shelly Oberon, the curvy genius. Hey, yo, Staples, come on. It's your turn. No. No, thanks. Wait. Just for a few minutes? It'll be fun. She's not big on fun. Ok. Fine. This may be the lamest thing I've ever done. I highly doubt that. Welcome to Jumanji! What's going on? I think it's shorting out. Unplug it! What's going on? What's happening to your hands?

You're crushing me! Get off! Get... What the hell? What happened to the rest of me? What is this? What is this on my back? What is this? Oh, my God. Fridge? Yeah, I'm Fridge. Who are you? I'm Spencer. What? The hell you are. What is going on? I think... we're in the game. Sorry, excuse me? What are you talking about? Somehow, I don't know how. I think we got, like, sucked into the game. And we've become the avatars that we chose. So it's me, Spencer, but yet I look and sound... like Dr. Smolder Bravestone. You're telling me that you're Spencer? Yes, yes, yes. That's it. Fridge, I'm Spencer. Which. Which means you're Moose Finbar. It says it right there on your vest. And... Martha? Yeah. You're Ruby Roundhouse. And Bethany... you're Professor Shelly Oberon. Only Shelly must be short for Sheldon. What are you talking about?",

What is it, like some type of old-school Nintendo? I don't think so. I don't recognize it. A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind. Jumanji. Staples, people. Staples. Jumanji? What does that mean? I have no idea. Never heard of it. Which one do I pick? I don't know. I don't think it matters that much. Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough pilot and rascal. It's not working. Ok, try another one. Franklin 'Moose' Finbar. He sounds like a badass. And he's a zoology expert, which is awesome. You pick. Ok. Dr. Smolder Bravestone. Bethany, you in? Fine. I'll be... Shelly Oberon, the curvy genius. Hey, yo, Staples, come on. It's your turn. No. No, thanks. Wait. Just for a few minutes? It'll be fun. She's not big on fun. Ok. Fine. This may be the lamest thing I've ever done. I highly doubt that. Welcome to Jumanji! What's going on? I think it's shorting out. Unplug it! What's going on? What's happening to your hands? What's wrong with you? I don't know. Spencer! Oh, my God! What the hell, man? Oh, no. Holy shit. Guys? Guys? Why do I sound like this? Where's my hair? What the... Oh, God! What kind of stupid-ass? Who are you? Who are you? Who is she? Who are you guys? Ok, what the hell? God! Oh, my God! Get off of me! I am totally suing. What's wrong with my voice? Get off of me! Where am I? You're crushing me! Get off! Get... What the hell? What happened to the rest of me? What is this? What is this on my back? What is this? Oh, my God. Fridge? Yeah, I'm Fridge. Who are you? I'm Spencer. What? The hell you are. What is going on? I think... we're in the game. Sorry, excuse me? What are you talking about? Somehow, I don't know how. I think we got, like, sucked into the game. And we've become the avatars that we chose. So it's me, Spencer, but yet I look and sound... like Dr. Smolder Bravestone. You're telling me that you're Spencer? Yes, yes, yes. That's it. Fridge, I'm Spencer. Which. Which means you're Moose Finbar. It says it right there on your vest. And... Martha? Yeah. You're Ruby Roundhouse. And Bethany... you're Professor Shelly Oberon. Only Shelly must be short for Sheldon. What are you talking about?"

You're the other character that was taken. So you're in the game too? Stay off the white bricks. And freeze. What? So gnarly. This game sucks. All right. Get this plank. Follow me. Careful. It's a horrible way to die. Oh, God. There you go. All right. Come on. I got it, I got it. I just defanged a snake. Give me a little respect. Ok. Hi there. Hi. Come on. Anyway, I'm Alex. Spencer Gilpin. Martha, Fridge and Bethany. Bethany? You're a girl? Woman. In real life, you'd probably wanna hit that. They got away. Looks like they had help. Seaplane. He must've crawled out of his hole. I'm sorry, boss. It won't happen again. I know it won't. What are you making? Margaritas. It's actually one of my strengths. That and piloting, although I did get shot down by a couple orangutans in fighter jets, so maybe not that great at it. Anyway, cheers. Thanks. Sure. I've never had alcohol before. Me neither. You know what? What the hell? And I'm done with that. It's good. Can I get one more of those? Alex? Yeah. What's up with all these candles? Citronella. One of my weaknesses is mosquitoes which... is kind of a bummer when you live alone in an open hut in the jungle. He's single. Who's this? Who's Alan Parrish? The guy who built this place. Wait, other people have been stuck here too? Yeah. This is Alan Parrish's house. I'm just living in it. So, Alex, tell me how long have you been in the game? Oh, it's tough to say. Time is kind of funny here. But... a few months, at least. A few months? What? Yeah, I just can't see to make it past the transportation shed. Transportation shed? What's that? It's the next level. First time, my hot-air balloon wouldn't even take off. And then there was the whole plane thing I mentioned. And once I got down to my last life... I realized I was screwed. And that I was never gonna get out of here by myself. Half the stuff that came at me, I had zero way to deal with. You can't kill a black mamba with a margarita. You sure can't. You need a zoologist for that. Alex, we can help each other. You've been here a long time, you know the game and, and between us, we have a lot of strengths. Yeah.

So you're in the game too? Stay off the white bricks. And freeze. What? So gnarly. This game sucks. All right. Get this plank. Follow me. Careful. It's a horrible way to die. Oh, God. There you go. All right. Come on. I got it, I got it. I just defanged a snake. Give me a little respect. Ok. Hi there. Hi. Come on. Anyway, I'm Alex. Spencer Gilpin. Martha, Fridge and Bethany. Bethany? You're a girl? Woman. In real life, you'd probably wanna hit that. They got away. Looks like they had help. Seaplane. He must've crawled out of his hole. I'm sorry, boss. It won't happen again. I know it won't. What are you making? Margaritas. It's actually one of my strengths. That and piloting, although I did get shot down by a couple orangutans in fighter jets, so maybe not that great at it. Anyway, cheers. Thanks. Sure. I've never had alcohol before. Me neither. You know what? What the hell? And I'm done with that. It's good. Can I get one more of those? Alex? Yeah. What's up with all these candles? Citronella. One of my weaknesses is mosquitoes which... is kind of a bummer when you live alone in an open hut in the jungle. He's single. Who's this? Who's Alan Parrish? The guy who built this place. Wait, other people have been stuck here too? Yeah. This is Alan Parrish's house. I'm just living in it. So, Alex, tell me how long have you been in the game? Oh, it's tough to say.

Which is one of my favorite biologies. Hello, little lady. What are you doing out here all alone? You are a badass. Hey. You guys like to dance? Oh, yeah, there we go. Which one, which one, which one? I hate this place. Her strength is dance fighting. Alex, what do you think? What's the move? What? What do we take? Which one? I don't... I don't know, man, Ok? I told you, I... We gotta fly, right? The helicopter? We gotta fly. I told you, I don't know. She's kicking their ass. That's our girl. Yes, queen! She is destroying them. You go, girl!"
