No. She went to a doctor, and he gave her pills. - You don't want to eat. - So? What's so good about that? I'm sitting here not thinking about chopped liver and pastrami on rye? You really shouldn't talk like that when someone's on a diet. Oh, big deal. I'll sneak another wedge of grapefruit. - I'm thinking thin. - Oh, Sara, the mailman. Sara Goldfarb?

I ate red meat to the point where I would eat it slab right off raw. Loved my meat. I turned it around. You need to be committed. You need to be passionate. No red meat. No red meat for 30 days. No red meat. You guys are terrific. Three things is all I did to change my life. Three things. - Ada told us.

All day? It's 1 :00. All day. - I'm thinking thin. - She's thinking thin. My Louise, she lost 50 pounds just like that. - Like that? - Like what? What did you do, put her in a sweatbox? No. She went to a doctor, and he gave her pills. - You don't want to eat. - So? What's so good about that? I'm sitting here not thinking about chopped liver and pastrami on rye? You really shouldn't talk like that when someone's on a diet. Oh, big deal. I'll sneak another wedge of grapefruit. - I'm thinking thin. - Oh, Sara, the mailman. Sara Goldfarb?
