Only thing missing from you, Boomer, is one of those stupid-looking ponytails and a collection of James Taylor songs on your iPod. l like James Taylor, but l don't have an iPod. Well, that's pretty amazing. What, no iPod? No cell phone or computer to keep you connected? lsn't it written somewhere in the baby boomer code book that you must own a certain percentage of anything Steve Jobs makes? So, what is it, on pilgrimage to change your life? Something like that. Wait. Don't tell me. Just getting over a nasty divorce, and she took it all. Or maybe you're out to meet some young chicks and relive your college glory days. Believe me, l've seen plenty of that nonsense. Oh, l got it. You're seeking penance for screwing over your company retirees in some stock market scandal. You sound really angry. Yeah, sure. l'm angry. l gotta quit these.

You got all those horrible signs of that desperate generation taking its final breath, trying to screw the rest of us over one last time. Only thing missing from you, Boomer, is one of those stupid-looking ponytails and a collection of James Taylor songs on your iPod. l like James Taylor, but l don't have an iPod. Well, that's pretty amazing. What, no iPod? No cell phone or computer to keep you connected? lsn't it written somewhere in the baby boomer code book that you must own a certain percentage of anything Steve Jobs makes? So, what is it, on pilgrimage to change your life? Something like that. Wait. Don't tell me. Just getting over a nasty divorce, and she took it all. Or maybe you're out to meet some young chicks and relive your college glory days. Believe me, l've seen plenty of that nonsense. Oh, l got it. You're seeking penance for screwing over your company retirees in some stock market scandal. You sound really angry. Yeah, sure. l'm angry. l gotta quit these.

What do you mean by that? Ah, well, l'm talking about tradition in the purest sense. A true pilgrim walks the Camino with nothing. He has to live off the land, he has to accept the kindness presented to him, and he has to carry his goods on his back. Pilgrim is poor and must suffer. SARAH: That strikes me as extreme to say the only way to be a true pilgrim is to imitate what we like to think a true pilgrim is. Should a pilgrim dress himself as a beggar even if he isn't? Do we honor the poor by imitating them? l don't think that pilgrims 500 years ago ignored the creature comforts of the road any more than we should now. JOOST: Yeah, and what about pilgrims on bikes or--or pilgrims that do the Camino on horseback? No, tradition would dismiss bikers at least. Biking or riding requires less suffering and less work. But l don't think we have to artificially add more hardship than is already there. That, in my opinion, is being a false pilgrim, not a true one. lf you were a man, l would challenge you to pistols at dawn.",

Hey, Boomer, Tom, we gotta camp out. Now, this, this is a true pilgrim experience. JOOST: Cheers to that, even though l hated camping as a boy. SARAH: \"True pilgrim experience\"? What do you mean by that? Ah, well, l'm talking about tradition in the purest sense. A true pilgrim walks the Camino with nothing. He has to live off the land, he has to accept the kindness presented to him, and he has to carry his goods on his back. Pilgrim is poor and must suffer. SARAH: That strikes me as extreme to say the only way to be a true pilgrim is to imitate what we like to think a true pilgrim is. Should a pilgrim dress himself as a beggar even if he isn't? Do we honor the poor by imitating them? l don't think that pilgrims 500 years ago ignored the creature comforts of the road any more than we should now. JOOST: Yeah, and what about pilgrims on bikes or--or pilgrims that do the Camino on horseback? No, tradition would dismiss bikers at least. Biking or riding requires less suffering and less work. But l don't think we have to artificially add more hardship than is already there. That, in my opinion, is being a false pilgrim, not a true one. lf you were a man, l would challenge you to pistols at dawn."
