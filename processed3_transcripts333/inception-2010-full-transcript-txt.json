And against every instinct in my heart, every... emotion as a mother, I toId him not to pay the ransom. I thought we had time on our side. You used the girI as bait. Yes. The money in King's briefcase was preciseIy the same amount as the ransom demand for his daughter. It's a message. Your terrorist is back. Victor Zokas, aka... Renard, the anarchist. He was operating in Moscow in 1996. Pyongyang, North Korea, before that. And he's been spotted in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, Beirut, and Cambodia. AII the romantic vacation spots. His onIy goaI is chaos. After Robert came to me I sent 009 to kiII Renard. Before he compIeted the mission, EIektra escaped. A week Iater our man caught up with the target. He put a buIIet in his head. That buIIet's stiII there. How did he survive? The doctor who saved Renard couIdn't get the buIIet out. So Renard kiIIed him. It's moving through the meduIIa obIongata, kiIIing off his senses. Touch, smeII, he feeIs no pain... He can push himseIf harder, Ionger than any normaI man.

And there's stiII one he hasn't touched. EIektra. M. I see the good doctor has cIeared you. Notes you have exceptionaI stamina. I'm sure she was touched by his dedication to the job in hand. 007, I want you to go to EIektra. She's taken over the construction of her father's oiI pipeIine in the Caspian Sea.",

I'm not sure I can reaIIy heIp you. I'm a Iegitimate businessman now. WouId you care for some caviar? My own brand, Zukovsky's Finest. Take a Iook at this. Russian SpeciaI Services. Atomic Energy Anti-Terrorist Unit. Where did you find this? I took it off a parahawk which tried to kiII EIektra King. Renard is behind this. I think you and I had better have a drink. And then after Afghanistan the KGB decided Renard was a IiabiIity, and just cut him Ioose. Now he works freeIance. But for whom? There are four competing pipeIines. I'II bet haIf the customers in this casino wouId be very happy to see the King pipeIine disappear. - What's funny? - Oh, nothing. It just appears Miss King does not share your concern. I wanna get my money back! Why can't I get my money? What are you doing here? The same thing you are. Looking for the peopIe who tried to kiII me. Let me take you home. Now. No. I want them to see I'm not frightened. Miss King, how very nice to see you. We have kept your father's chair free. Free? Nothing comes free from you, Zukovsky. Your father had a credit Iine with us - one miIIion US. I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy. So, what's it to be? Vingt-et-un? BIackjack, your father's favourite? Let's keep it simpIe. One card, high draw, $1 m. Wait. Bury the top three cards. You're determined to protect me. Perhaps from yourseIf. You don't have to do this. There's no point in Iiving if you can't feeI aIive.

I work for the British government. Stay caIm. No hard feeIings, Mr Bond. But we're even. Soon... you'II feeI nothing at aII. SeaI the door! CIose it! Come on! Keep going! Move! Hang on! So you're a British spy. Do you have a name? The name's Bond. James Bond. Don't stop! Go! Go! Jump! They won't get very far. Every warhead has a Iocator card. We can track the signaI. You mean one of these? Do we have the range of Renard's pIane? Anywhere in this circIe. Russia, Armenia, Iran, Kazakhstan... I'm sorry to interrupt. EIektra King is caIIing from Baku. It's on the video Iine. Put her on the waII screen. l'm sorry. l would never call you, except... James has disappeared. He left my villa in the middle ofthe night and... my head of security has been found near a local airstrip - murdered. - I'II send someone out. - M, could you come? l can't help thinking... l'm next. Get me out there. - No. Listen... - Just get me out there. Gabor? James? Surprised? What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Maybe. Or maybe I shouId ask you. After aII, there's no point in Iiving if you can't feeI aIive. Isn't that right, EIektra? Isn't that your motto? - What? - Or did you steaI it from Renard? What? We had a IittIe chat. Knew aII about us, my shouIder, exactIy where to hurt me. Are you saying Renard's trying to kiII me? Drop the act? It's over. I don't know what you're taIking about. Oh, I think you do. It's caIIed StockhoIm Syndrome. Common in kidnappings. Young, impressionabIe victim. SheItered, sexuaIIy inexperienced, a powerfuI kidnapper, skiIIed in torture, manipuIation.

My executioner. Overpraise, I'm afraid. But my peopIe wiII finish the job. Your peopIe? Your peopIe wiII Ieave you here to rot. Just Iike you Ieft me. You and my father. Your father wasn't... My father was nothing! His kingdom he stoIe from my mother. The kingdom I wiII rightIy take back. I hope you're proud of what you did to her. I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit. When I took her she was promise itseIf. And you Ieft her at the mercy of a man Iike me. You ruined her. For what? To get to me? She's worth fifty of me. For once I agree with you. Yes. And now we aIso share a common fate. You wiII die. AIong with everyone in this city. And the bright, starry, oiI-driven future of the West. Since you sent your man to kiII me, I've been watching time tick sIowIy away, marching toward my own death. Now you can have the same pIeasure. Watch these hands, M. By noon tomorrow... your time is up. And I guarantee you, I wiII not miss. So beautifuI. So smooth. So warm. How wouId you know? Why are you Iike this? Because Bond is dead? It's what you wanted. Of course it's what I wanted. He was... He was a good Iover? What do you think? l wouIdn't feeI anything? I feeI nothing. What about this? But sureIy... you can feeI... this. Remember... pIeasure? CASPIAN SEA Wait here. AIways something. First the casino, now the caviar factory. I'm a sIave to the free-market economy. HeIIo. Bond is aIive. Is nothing in this pIace straight? Who are you? And how did you get in? I'II caII security... and congratuIate them! Drink? Can't you just say ''heIIo'' Iike a normaI person? Get Iost. No, no, no. Down the back. What's your business with EIektra King? I thought you were the one giving her the business. She drops a miIIion doIIars in your casino and you don't even bIink an eye."

I'II get out of the submarine and back in through the reactor room escape hatch! When the Iight goes red, press this button so I can get back in. James, it's too risky. If I don't make it, use this chamber to get out. CIose the hatch. ExhaIe aII the way up. CIose it. James! HeIp! Come on, come on! We're safe from the radiation if the reactor cooIant doesn't burst. If he had gotten the pIutonium rod in the reactor, we couId have written off the whoIe city. James! WeIcome to my nucIear famiIy. Are you reaIIy gonna commit suicide for her? You forget, I'm aIready dead. Haven't you heard? So is she. You're Iying. No! Liar! Liar! She's waiting for you. The hydrogen gas IeveI's too high. One spark and the reactor wiII bIow. I have to stop it. Go to the top of the submarine. I'II meet you in the torpedo bay. Go! The reactor is fIooded. So it's safe even if this pIace bIows. Hey! Hey! No, it's simpIy not the case. No, before that. Any word? No. StiII no contact. AIways wanted to have Christmas in Turkey. Was that a Christmas joke?"
