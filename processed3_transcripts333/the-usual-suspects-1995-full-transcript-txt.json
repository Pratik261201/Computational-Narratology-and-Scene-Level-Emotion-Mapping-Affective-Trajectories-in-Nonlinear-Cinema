      "raw_text": "How you doin', Keaton? I can't feel my legs, Keyser. Ready? What time is it? 12.30. It all started back in New York six weeks ago. A truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of Queens. The driver saw nobody, but somebody fucked up. He heard a voice. Sometimes that's all you need. Mr McManus? Christ, don't you fuckin' guys ever sleep? - We have a warrant for your arrest. - Fuck you, pig. Todd Hockney? - Who wants to know? - New York Police Department. Shit. Freeze! Hold it! Sure you brought enough guys? It's quite simple. A restaurant that changes with the taste without losing the overall aesthetic. In other words, the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls. - Where will it be? - Let me give you an example. This I had to see for myself. David. - I'm in a meeting. - Time for another one. Everyone, this is David Kujan. Special Agent Kujan, US Customs. These gentlemen are from the New York Police Department. You look good, Keaton. Better than I would have thought. Il y a un problème? A small matter of a stolen truck loaded with guns. - Mr Keaton? - Will you excuse us for a moment? We have some questions to ask you downtown. - Peut-être nous vous laisserions... - No, no, no, please. Please sit down. This is... This is a small problem. - Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later. - OK. - Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé là? - Non, c'est pas du tout un problème. - C'est la police, n'est-ce pas? - Ça a l'air. Ça va. Unique. Oui! It didn't make sense that I'd be there. I mean, these guys were hard-core hijackers. But there I was. At that point I wasn't scared. I knew I hadn't done anything they could do me for. Besides, it was fun. I got to make like I was notorious. You know the drill. When your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given. Number one, step forward. Hand me the keys, you fucking cocksucker. Number two, step forward. Give me the fucking keys, you fucking cocksucker, motherfucker... Knock it off! Get back! Number three, step forward. - Hand me the keys. - In English, please. - Excuse me? - In English! Hand me the fucking keys, you cocksucker. What the fuck? Number four, step forward. It was bullshit. The whole rap was a setup. Hand me the keys, you fucking cocksucker. It was all the cops' fault. You don't put guys like that into a room together.",

Somebody was pissed about that truck getting hijacked. They were hoping somebody would give them something to go on. They knew we wouldn't fight it because they knew how to lean on us. Our rights went out the window. It was a violation. Disgraceful. They went after McManus first - a top-notch entry man. - What truck? - The truck with the guns, fucko. Fucko? He was a good guy. Crazy though. Wanna know what Fenster told us? - Say who? - McManus! He told us another story. Oh, is that the one about the hooker with dysentery? Fenster always worked with McManus. He was a tight-ass, but when it came to the job he was right-on a smart man. - What are you saying? - I said he'll flip you. - He'll what? - Flip you. Flip you for real. - Yeah, I'm shakin' Come on. - OK. - Answer my question. - Can you hear me in the back? Hello? I want my lawyer. I'm gonna have your fuckin' badge, cocksucker. Todd Hockney. Good with explosives. Without a doubt, the one guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on. You think so? I could put you in Queens on the night of the hijacking. Really? I live in Queens. Did you put that together yourself, Einstein? Got a team of monkeys workin' on this? You know what happens if you do another turn in the joint? Fuck your father in the shower, then have a snack. You gonna charge me? When I'm ready. - With what? - You know damn well, dead man. But Keaton was the real prize for them, for obvious reasons. It was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever stop to ask me? Hm? I mean, I've been walking around with the same face, the same name. - I'm a business man. - What's that, the restaurant business? From now on you're in the getting-fucked-by-us business. I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker. Like I said, it was your mistake. Not mine. Now, you charge me with this shit and I'll beat it. OK? Let's get back to the truck, asshole. Argh! I really, really think somebody should do something about this shit. So I did a little time. Does that mean I get railed every time a truck finds its way... Fuck 'em! Fenster, will you relax?

A heavyweight criminal lawyer from uptown. I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket. How about it, Keaton? You a lawyer's wife? - What kind of retainer are you givin' her? - Whoops! Hey, Fenster, do your friend a favour. Tell him to keep quiet. Dean Keaton. Gone clean, huh? Say it ain't so. Or was it you that hit that truck? Mac, Mac, forget him.

A public defender can get you outta that one. - So why the hell was I strip-searched? - That was the feds. Truckload of guns get snagged. Customs comes down on NYPD wanting answers. They come up with us. They're clutching at straws. - I had a guy's finger up my asshole. - Is it Friday already? Yeah, lover boy. You want a piece? So who in the goddamn piss hell stole our fucking truck? - What did you say? - Who stole the fucking truck? - I don't want to know. - Who asked you, working man? Fuck who did it! I wanna know who's the gimp. - He's OK. - How do I know that? - What about it? What's your story? - His name is Verbal. - Verbal Kint. - Verbal? - Yeah. - Roger really. People say I talk too much. - I was just gonna tell you to shut up. - We met before once or twice. - In county. I was in for fraud. - A line-up then, too. What happened? I walked. 90 days, suspended. - So you did it! - All right, now, look. We've all been put out by this whole thing, right? So I figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity, hm?

Sure. There, see? So now I'd like to exercise my right to free assembly. Why don't you just shut up? You're missing the point. No. You're missing the point. I don't wanna hear anything from you. I don't care about your job. And, um, I want nothing to do with any of you. I beg your pardon, but you can all go to hell. Dean Keaton, gone the high road. What is the world coming to? Fuck him. That was how it started. Five men brought in on a trumped-up charge to be leaned on by halfwits. OK. Now I really can't talk about it much here... What the cops never figured out, and what I know now, was that these men would never break, never lie down, never bend over for anybody. Anybody. - Who are you? - Agent Jack Baer, FBI. How many dead? 15 so far. They're still pulling bodies out of the water though. - Any survivors? - Yeah, two. One guy's in county hospital, but he's in a coma. The DA has a second guy, a cripple from New York, I think. The chief wants this place sealed off. If you have any questions, give him a call. This is Dave Kujan. I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday. If you need to reach me, call Jeff Rabin of the San Pedro PD on extension 112. Have a nice day. - Why can't I see him? - Dave, I told you. The DA came last night ready to arraign even before they moved him to county. Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later, DA comes out the office looking like he'd been smacked around. They take his statement and they cut him a deal. - Did they charge him with anything? - Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanour two. What is that? Listen, I give the DA credit for getting that much. Understand? Excuse me, sir. This whole thing has turned political. The mayor was here last night. The chief. This morning the governor called, OK? I'm telling you this guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of Darkness. - Take my word for it. - When does he post bail? - Two hours, tops. - I wanna see him. - No, Dave. - I gotta see him. - Dave, no! I cannot do this for you. - You gotta. I came a long way for this. Dave, please. Even if I let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid.",

        "- What do you care what he has to say? I'm just talkin' here. It seems like Mr Hockney wants to hear what I got to say. I know Fenster's down. What about you, guy? I'm interested. Sure. There, see? So now I'd like to exercise my right to free assembly. Why don't you just shut up? You're missing the point. No. You're missing the point. I don't wanna hear anything from you. I don't care about your job. And, um, I want nothing to do with any of you. I beg your pardon, but you can all go to hell. Dean Keaton, gone the high road. What is the world coming to? Fuck him. That was how it started. Five men brought in on a trumped-up charge to be leaned on by halfwits. OK. Now I really can't talk about it much here... What the cops never figured out, and what I know now, was that these men would never break, never lie down, never bend over for anybody. Anybody. - Who are you? - Agent Jack Baer, FBI. How many dead? 15 so far. They're still pulling bodies out of the water though. - Any survivors? - Yeah, two. One guy's in county hospital, but he's in a coma. The DA has a second guy, a cripple from New York, I think. The chief wants this place sealed off. If you have any questions, give him a call. This is Dave Kujan. I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday. If you need to reach me, call Jeff Rabin of the San Pedro PD on extension 112. Have a nice day. - Why can't I see him? - Dave, I told you. The DA came last night ready to arraign even before they moved him to county. Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later, DA comes out the office looking like he'd been smacked around. They take his statement and they cut him a deal. - Did they charge him with anything? - Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanour two. What is that? Listen, I give the DA credit for getting that much. Understand? Excuse me, sir. This whole thing has turned political. The mayor was here last night. The chief. This morning the governor called, OK? I'm telling you this guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of Darkness. - Take my word for it. - When does he post bail? - Two hours, tops. - I wanna see him. - No, Dave. - I gotta see him. - Dave, no! I cannot do this for you. - You gotta. I came a long way for this. Dave, please. Even if I let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid."

The man with the plan, huh? - Interested in any more work? - We're always lookin' for extra work. - We're on vacation. - Well, that's too bad. I got a ton of work and I don't have any good people like you guys. - What's the job? - A jeweller out of Texas named Saul. He rents a suite in some downtown hotel. He does free appraisals for people. Anyway, the word is he carries around a lot of cash. So I figure I keep the merchandise, you keep the green. Simple. - What about security? - Bodyguards. Nothing you can't handle. - Give me time to check it out? - I'd expect nothing less from you, man. Good to see you. We'll call you. Enjoy LA, huh? Get yourself laid. Hey, uh... A friend of mine in New York tells me that you know, that you knew Spook Hollis. The way I hear it, you did time with old Spook. Good man, wasn't he? I used to run dope for him. - Too bad he got shieved. - Yeah. I shieved him. Better you hear it from me now than from somebody else later. I appreciate that. Just out of curiosity, was it business or personal? A bit of both. Well, like I said, you give me a call if you're interested, all right? Is there a problem? One job. That was the deal. One job? One job! That's a good one, Keaton. Keaton fought it as best he could, but a man can't change what he is. He can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself. It took one day with McManus nagging him, and we went back to work. So, I get out of my car. I think it's wrecked. In the back seat of the other car, this woman's totally naked! - I'm laughin' so hard, I can't breathe. - Get in the car, Saul. Freeze! Freeze! There's a second one here somewhere. Give me the case. Give me the fuckin' case! Give me the case. I'm telling you for the last time, give me the fuckin' case! - Come on! - Hey! Don't move. Look, just hand over the case. Hand over the fuckin' case! Come on. Let's go! - Come on! - Bad day. Fuck it. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Fuck! Looks like a lot of china to me. Shit. Guys, come on. - What're you doin'?",

I come with an offer directly from Mr Söze. - An order, actually. - What do you mean \"an order\"? In 1981, Mr Keaton, you participated in a hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York. The cargo was raw steel. Steel which belonged to Mr Söze and which was destined for Pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor. A most profitable violation of UN regulations. You had no way of knowing this because the fellow shipping the steel was working for Mr Söze without his knowledge. Earlier this year Mr Fenster and Mr McManus hijacked a flight out of Newark. The plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring, also set for Pakistan. Two months ago Mr Hockney stole a truck carrying gun parts through Queens. Gun parts which were set to be destroyed by the State of New York. They were to be lost in a way station and rerouted to Belfast. Again Mr Söze, using pawns who had no knowledge. Which brings us to Mr Kint. Nine months ago one of Mr Söze's less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence scam by a cripple. He was relieved of $62,000. Now, it has taken us some time to find you. Our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in New York. - You set up the line-up? - Yes. You were not to be released until I arrived. It seems Ms Finneran was a little too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you was a moot point. - What about Redfoot? - Mr Redfoot knew nothing.

That you did not know you stole from him is the only reason you are still alive. He feels you owe him. You will repay your debt. All right, fuck the debt and fuck you. How do we know you work for Söze? I don't think that is relevant, Mr Hockney. All five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards. Mr Redfoot can testify to your involvement and we can see to it he will. - What's your point? - The offer is this, gentlemen. Mr Söze's primary interest is narcotics. He's been competing, shall we say, with a group of Argentinians for years now. Competing with Mr Söze has taken its toll. The Argentinians are negotiating the sale of $91m in cocaine in three days' time. This purchase will revitalise the diminishing strength of their organisation. Mr Söze would like you to stop the deal. If you choose, you may wait until after the buy. Whatever money changes hands is yours. Mr Söze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine on board. And then you will be free of your obligations to Mr Söze. You give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now. A gift from Mr Söze. Good day, gentlemen. My whole life's in here - everything I've done since I was 18. They fuckin' know everything. Everybody I've ever worked with or did time with. No. - This isn't right. - I don't know. Who was that guy who used to talk about Söze in New York? - Bricks Marlin. - Yeah, I did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. He said he always made five times more money than the job was worth. This guy's a pipe dream. Kobayashi's usin' him for window-dressing. - I don't know. This is bad. - No, it's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD. It's a fuckin' set-up. The way I hear it, Söze is some kind of butcher. - A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher. - There is no Keyser Söze! Who is Keyser Söze? He's supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German. Nobody ever believed he was real. Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody that worked directly for him, but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could've worked for him. You never knew. That was his power. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.",

Mr Redfoot can testify to your involvement and we can see to it he will. - What's your point? - The offer is this, gentlemen. Mr Söze's primary interest is narcotics. He's been competing, shall we say, with a group of Argentinians for years now. Competing with Mr Söze has taken its toll. The Argentinians are negotiating the sale of $91m in cocaine in three days' time. This purchase will revitalise the diminishing strength of their organisation. Mr Söze would like you to stop the deal. If you choose, you may wait until after the buy. Whatever money changes hands is yours. Mr Söze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine on board. And then you will be free of your obligations to Mr Söze. You give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now. A gift from Mr Söze. Good day, gentlemen. My whole life's in here - everything I've done since I was 18. They fuckin' know everything. Everybody I've ever worked with or did time with. No. - This isn't right. - I don't know. Who was that guy who used to talk about Söze in New York? - Bricks Marlin. - Yeah, I did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. He said he always made five times more money than the job was worth. This guy's a pipe dream. Kobayashi's usin' him for window-dressing. - I don't know. This is bad. - No, it's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD. It's a fuckin' set-up. The way I hear it, Söze is some kind of butcher. - A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher. - There is no Keyser Söze! Who is Keyser Söze? He's supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German. Nobody ever believed he was real. Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody that worked directly for him, but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could've worked for him. You never knew. That was his power. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."

I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser from Justice. He has a file on Söze in DC. Been a hobby of his.

It was his idea to hit the taxi service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth. It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning. I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Oh, Christ! You're not safe on your own. - You think he's... - Keyser Söze? I don't know, Verbal. Keyser Söze's a shield. Or, like you said, a spook story. But I know Keaton, and someone is out there pulling strings for you. - Stay and let us protect you. - No way. I'm not bait. I post today. You posted 20 minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here ASAP, unless you turn state's. I'll take my chances. If someone wants to get you, they're gonna get you out there. Turn state's evidence. You might never see trial. Maybe so. But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan. Fuckin' cops. Excuse me. Can I use your fax machine? You'll have to sign for these, Mr Kint. One watch, gold. One cigarette lighter, gold. One pack of cigarettes. Thank you. We've still got nothing, Dave. I know what I wanted to know about Keaton. Which is nothing. No matter. He'll have to know how close we came. Keyser Söze or no Keyser Söze, if Keaton is alive, he's not coming up again. I'll find him. Waste of time. A rumour's not a rumour that doesn't die. - What? - Nothin'. - Man, you're a slob. - Yeah, but it all has a system, Dave. It all makes sense when you look at it right. You gotta stand back from it. You wanna see a real horror show, you should see my garage. Convince me. When I was in that barbershop quartet in Skokie. Where's your head, Agent Kujan? - We need to think back. - You've heard many tales. - Bricks Marlin. - I wanna hear your story. It's all there. Some guy in California, his name is Redfoot. - A gift from Mr Söze. - What about Redfoot? - Mr Redfoot knew nothing. - Big, fat guy. I mean, orca fat. There was a lawyer. Kobayashi. When I was picking beans in Guatemala, we'd make fresh coffee. - You thought he was a good man. - I know he was good. - Tell me every last detail. - How do you shoot the devil? - He's protected by the Prince of... - What's your story? - There was a lawyer. - What lawyer, Verbal? - I am Mr Kobayashi. - Kobayashi.",
