It's a village without boutique or... ...Club Med or T-shirts. We've managed to avoid the 20th century. Intend to be dead before the 21st. It's quite a trick. Who are you? Who, me? I'm the doc, Geoffrey Washburn. The doc. And you? We need to notify the authorities. People might be looking for you. What's your name? Where do you live? I need to know where to send my outrageous bill. It's a miracle you're alive, old son. My head. I gotta sleep. - Just your name. - Huh? You do have a name? My name... My name is... I have no idea. My God! I don't know! Sometimes, with rest, everything comes back. And sometimes, nothing more than bits and pieces. Ever. Trouble is, you see, I... ...I'm not a brain surgeon. I may have disconnected some wiring in there. - Fishing out bullets. - Bullets? It won't help to concentrate. Relax. Let images float in. Let the subconscious mind have a chance. This boat, what happened to it? Why was I on it? Somebody shot me. Why? - I have to remember. - It won't work that way. There was no report of a trawler lost, or any boat lost. What else? Nightmares. As violent as anything I've ever seen. The kids from the village come up to watch, no commercials, you see. In these nightmares, you speak French, Spanish, German and something Oriental. Can't remember those either. - And, you've undergone plastic surgery. - Plastic surgery? Your nose, chin, cheekbones have been worked on. - What? - Originally you looked different. - I must've been in an accident. - I don't think so. The scars would have been different, more like the scars all over the rest of your body. Most of them 12, 15 years old. Scars, I'd guess, from bullets, shrapnel, that sort of thing. A war? Maybe. But, you see, the trouble is, you've been sewn up... ...better than any army normally sews up its boys. It's all very peculiar. How I'm ever gonna find out who I am if I've been turned into somebody else? Geoff, I don't know what to do. Help me. - Break it down. Fast! - What? Break it down! How did I know how to do that? I don't know. Three Cuban diplomats were expelled from the country... ...in connection with the worldwide search for the terrorist called Carlos.",

We have increased security measures at all of our foreign embassies, and of course... ...we're cooperating with Interpol and the French authorities... ...in a worldwide search for the terrorist Carlos. You were responsible for the ambassador Leland safety. How do you feel about his assassination? Who are you? Why do I know you? I feel a sense of outrage and deep personal loss. He was a close friend. When we find Carlos, and we will... ...I intend to question him myself. That's all I can say. Thank you. This is Nigel Colman, reporting from Nice. Carlos. May I help you, sir? I have an account here. If you'll tell me the number of zeros in your account... ...I can direct you to the correct office. Three zeros. Take the elevator, sir. Fifth floor. Thank you. Three-zero account on the way to the fifth floor. My name is Fritz Koenig, sir. Three-zero accounts rarely come in without an appointment. I'm afraid you startled our man in the lobby. I can't help that. I'm in a hurry. Of course. If you'll sign in. Your signature. Of course. Would you wait in here, please? Where are you taking that? - To Signature Verifications, of course. - I'm in a great hurry, Her Koenig. I'm following procedures you yourself requested, sir. I've got his fingerprints. We're ready down here. Walter Apfel, at your service. Mr. Apfel. I trust you're enjoying your stay in Zurich? Very much. My room overlooks the lake. It's beautiful. Shall I unlock this for you or would you prefer to do it yourself? Be my guest. Please. Open it. Oh, no, sir. I can unlock it for you, but the opening is your responsibility. - If your identity is listed, it's not my position... - Of course."

Say it! - Telephone number... -...it's a dress shop in Saint Honore. - A dress shop? It is called Bergeron. Jason, come on. Come on. Call Peter. See what he's found out while I change. Lisa, it's Marie St. Jacques. May I speak to Peter? What? What? When? I just talked to him earlier today. Oh, my God. What? What's happened? - They killed him. - What? He went to the airport to meet the man from Washington. When he didn't come back to the office, Lisa called the airport. They found his body in one of the tunnels to the parking lot. Oh, Marie... Treadstone. Your precious Treadstone. They're murderers! He asked about them to help me, to help us... - Stop it. Look... - Your people, Jason. Your people are murderers! - All of you are murderers! Let me go! - Calm down! - Marie... - I can't be part of this. Marie. Marie! Gentlemen, the president wants to know what's going on. Peter White, a man at the Canadian Treasury... ...calls the NSC asking about this organization Treadstone and is shot. Did you people kill him because he blew your cover? - Senator... - Or was it Carlos again? - I think it was Bourne. - Bourne? You're convinced, General Conklin, that Bourne is also responsible for the assassination of Ambassador Leland. I am. - Either by himself or working for Carlos. - Poppycock! Mr. Abbott? Well, apparently, senator, we don't have a consensus yet."

The woman from Bergeron's. - The one in red... ...was at general Villiers son's funeral in the photo in the Sorbonne. That proves Villiers is involved. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Now, do exactly as I tell you. Slide over in the driver's seat and start the car. Now, drive ahead. Once I'm inside, drive off. Carlos! Father... -...do you speak English? - A little. A few moments ago, two women came in. The young one in red dress... ...the older with the very short dark hair. Did you see them? Oh yes. The younger woman brought the other to confession. - Did you hear the confession? - No, no. One of the visiting Fathers from Spain - I must find her. There's been an emergency. - She was in the second confessional. I don't know if she's there. I think I saw Father Manuel leave. We have to talk, general. Get in the car. - What is this? - We have to talk. - I'm prepared to shoot. - Go on then, shoot! I have no problem killing you, general, since you've become messenger for Carlos. - I'll kill you. - Kill me. - You deny being Carlos' man? - I spit on him. He killed my son... ...my only son. Five sticks of dynamite. Your phone number is at Bergeron's, Carlos' Paris headquarters. Never. Impossible. You don't know what you are saying.

        "We have an appointment. - Where are we going? It's time you met Carlos. - That's Madame Jacqui. The woman from Bergeron's. - The one in red... ...was at general Villiers son's funeral in the photo in the Sorbonne. That proves Villiers is involved. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Now, do exactly as I tell you. Slide over in the driver's seat and start the car. Now, drive ahead. Once I'm inside, drive off. Carlos! Father... -...do you speak English? - A little. A few moments ago, two women came in. The young one in red dress... ...the older with the very short dark hair. Did you see them? Oh yes. The younger woman brought the other to confession. - Did you hear the confession? - No, no. One of the visiting Fathers from Spain - I must find her. There's been an emergency. - She was in the second confessional. I don't know if she's there. I think I saw Father Manuel leave. We have to talk, general. Get in the car. - What is this? - We have to talk. - I'm prepared to shoot. - Go on then, shoot! I have no problem killing you, general, since you've become messenger for Carlos. - I'll kill you. - Kill me. - You deny being Carlos' man? - I spit on him. He killed my son... ...my only son. Five sticks of dynamite. Your phone number is at Bergeron's, Carlos' Paris headquarters. Never. Impossible. You don't know what you are saying. I know exactly what I'm saying 'coz I found it there myself. And it is your number. Who are you? - Names are unimportant. - Unimportant?

You could cast a line... ...into a pool of water under the trees, sidearm. Read, Davey, read. Everything you can get your hands on, but especially history. Oh, Davey, what a lovely present. Let's put it on the mantel where we'll always see it. - Hey, stupid, what are you doing here? - You Dugan? - Who are you? - I'm from Shape-Up. - Said you could use another man. You want me to start in here? - Well, I can't. The stairs are too narrow already. The men I got are crawling over each other's butts. Go on back, get out of here. Hey, Schumach sent me over here. Schumach. All right, start at the top. Start with the single wood units, as heavy as you can carry, and don't give me no coffee break garbage. - Yeah. Yeah. - Third floor. Die! Die! Hold it. Slow down. I'll kill you! You're all right. It's over. We're not the enemy. You are the enemy. I'll take you all, it doesn't matter. I don't care anymore! They're dead. - They're all dead. - Jason!

In human dignity. In fighting for what is true and good. And right. And just. It is not fitting. We killed too many people, David. You taught me to be a monster to catch a monster. Along the way, part of me became the monster. You taught me to kill like you taught me to play tennis... ...with skill and detachment. Without mercy. Without thought. Tonight we fly back to Vermont. They say I was a teacher. Maybe I'll teach again, and fish. Maybe I can put the pieces back together. Some of them at least. I can think about how I became what I became and how to forgive you. And how to forgive myself. And how, maybe, to love again.",
