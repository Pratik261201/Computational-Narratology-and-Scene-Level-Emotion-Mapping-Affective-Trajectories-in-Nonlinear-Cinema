Spending some quiet time- just you and your very best friend. Of course, that wasn't my experience. That kid's not even me. That's me, and that crazy hound I'm chasing is Marley... - the world's worst dog- - Sorry! - Or so I thought. - Marley! But our story begins before Marley was born- Four years before, on my wedding day- which also happened to be the day of the worst freak spring blizzard... in the history of southern Michigan. Same day our car broke down. We didn't care. Ooh. God, that feels so good. Ohh! Wow. So, what do you think- What do you think that means- a blizzard on your wedding day? Is that good luck? Is that bad luck? I think- I think it's good luck. - How did I get you? - What? No, honestly. How did I- How did I get that lucky? Well, you know... I get asked that question all the time. Come on. Are you kidding, honey? You're part of the plan. - The plan? - Mm-hmm. My plan. Step one- Meet an incredibly sweet, smart, sexy man. Done. Step two? Marry you instead. Oh, now-And step three- - No, I don't think I can take any more steps. - You don't wanna hear step three? - Yeah. What's step three? - It's easy. - Be gentle. - Move someplace warmer. I knew you were gonna say that. Shiny, happy people laughing Meet me in the crowd People, people Throw your love around Love me, love me Take it into town Happy, happy Put it in the ground Where the flowers grow Gold and silver shine Shiny, happy people holding hands Shiny, happy people - Thank you. - All right, you know you got this, right? - Oh, yeah. I got it. - Who are you? - I'm John Grogan? - No, you'reJohn friggin' Grogan... who's about to get a job as a reporter... for a major metropolitan newspaper. - Mmm. Mmm. - Good. Good. But now I don't feel like getting out of the car. - You have to. No, baby. - Maybe we'll just drive around the block. Come on, get out of the car. Get out. - Now, who am I again? - Oh, please. Sebastian says you won some kind of award. Mitchie. I have a Mitchie. It's like a Pulitzer, but from western Michigan. A Mitchie. So, tell me-What made you leave the estimable... Kalamazoo Gazette? Well, as you know, Sebastian and I were in college together...",

Sorry about the mess- - And the noise and the smell. - What's happening? Come on. - Can I look? - No, no. Just-Almost. Almost. - Okay. Okay. Ready? - Really? One, two, three. Go. Happy birthday. What? God, they're adorable. Oh, my- My birthday's not for a month. That's okay. They can't leave for three weeks anyway. - We didn't discuss this. - I know, but it's a surprise. You can't. - Hi, guys. - Just adopted the mom last month. Family that gave her up didn't even know she was pregnant. - Are you sure we're ready for this? - Well, like I told you... you gotta wait three weeks for them to be weaned before you can bring 'em home. - I'm not even gonna be here. - Why? - I'll be in Gainesville, covering that trial. - Oh, that's right. That's okay. It'll give me a chance to bond with him... - and get a head start on training 'im- - That's true. - Get 'im squared away before you get home. - That's true. - Well, how are we gonna pick one? - Girls are 300. Boys are 275. Except for that little guy there. Him you could have for 200 even. This one? You're so sweet. You're like a little clearance puppy. - Hello, puppy. - This one likes you. Clearance Puppy likes you. - Well, that's your guy. - Aw. I was gonna pick you anyway. Don't tell anybody. Don't tell the others. We gotta double-time itjust a little here, honey. - Really wish I didn't have to go. - Are you kidding me? It's gonna be great. You spent eight months on this trial. - Honestly, I'm jealous. - Really? Tax evasion? That's what makes you jealous? Well, it's sexier than speed bumps. - Okay, you call me the minute you get him home. - Okay. Okay. - We also have to come up with a name for him. - Yes. Let's brainstorm it.

Marley, stop. I had to pull him off three dogs today. - Poodles? - Among others. I say we give him away to a farm. Isn't that usually what you do with dogs that are out of control? Well, usually you- Usually you train them. Or you train 'em. Come on. Down. Go on. What are you doing? Arnie gave me a column. Are you kidding? Baby, that's great. Oh, yeah. It's a big honor. I get to write about zoning laws... and give my opinion on yard sales. Whoa. Down, boy. Easy with the enthusiasm. Well, no, it's just, I don't even read this crap when other people write it. Now I'm supposed to, you know, write two columns a week? And you got nothin'for Tuesday. No. I got nothin' for Tuesday. I bet you're gonna think of something. Now, see, this gives me a little inspiration, but it's not for a column. It's more like- Look at Marley. Now he's eating the floor. Marley, stop. Marley, you're incorrigible. Incorrigible? I don't believe in that word. Every dog wants to learn. Hey, come here, baby. Yes, you're a good girl. You're a good girl. Yes, you are. 'Course, they can't learn if their parents are weak-willed. Yeah. Well, I'm pretty strong-willed, but- - Marley- - Say hello to Marley. So which of you is gonna be the trainer? Well, we both thought we would, 'cause we'd like him to listen to both of us at home. - We're married too. Yeah. - No, no, no, no. A dog can only have one master. Which one of you has the most natural authority in your own relationship?"

There's nothing she can do? No tantrum too big? No depression too deep? No failure to perform wifely duties that would push you over the edge? Why do you jump right to splitting up? Come on, buddy. Mend it, don't end it. - So life is better with Jenny than without her? - Yes. What is- Are you wearing a wire? Jen, are you- She's listening to this. Jenny, yes, we had a fight, but I still love you. Come on, buddy. I had a fight with my wife. Let me just sulk. I just wanna know if you're really happy. Oh, wait. There she is. - Who? - Give me the kid. No, I can't be a party to this. That's-That's shameless. This is gonna be even better than the puppy. No, not my son. Marley, no. Please, please, Marley. Please. Marley! Marley, what are you- Marley, God, look at- Stop it! Why do you do this? Why do you ruin everything? Go on! Patrick! Are you okay? I'm sorry. Get that dog out of here. - I want that dog out of here right now. - I'll take him for a walk. I'm not kidding. No, you take him to that farm. All right, buddy, looks like we're going to the farm again. I'm serious. I'm not kidding. I want- I can't take this anymore. - What did he do? - Everything! What hasn't he done? He's just a horrible, horrible animal. - Well, that's a little unfair. - No, what's unfair... is that Conor hasn't slept in two weeks because of that dog's barking... that Patrick gets knocked down twice a day... that I can't even think straight. God forbid there's a hint of thunder. - Just don't! - Just calm down for a second. I know that it's been a rough couple of months with the new baby and everything. I understand that. But I was talking with Arnie. - And postpartum dep- - Don't you dare. I am not depressed. I am exhausted. I'm not angry because of some condition. I can't even go out for an hour without the kids... because every babysitter in this neighborhood is terrified of Marley. I know that, but you were the one that said you didn't wanna work anymore."

I know people probably say that all the time, but to be honest... I'm not sure he really is a dog. He once ate an answering machine. Just polished it off. He didn't chew it. He ate it. And then digested it. Then went and had the phone for dessert. Another time, my son had colic and this guy sat up all night, didn't move... just stayed right there for nine hours just keeping an eye on Conor.

Sometimes they're sad and sometimes they're really funny... silly or whatever, but- but they're all you. And for those five minutes... you make me feel better. You should read them. They're pretty great. Might even make a nice book. - A book? - Something. Hello? All right. Thank you. He's coming home. Is he there? Of course he's there. He's always there. - How does he know we're coming? - I don't know. He just knows. Dogs know stuff like that. - All dogs? - All good dogs. - Look, there he is! There he is! Marley. - Yeah. Hi, Marley. - Marley. - How you doin', Marley. - I missed you at school. - I'll race you to the house. - Okay. - Go! - Eagles? - Yeah, the Eagles are going all the way. I guarantee you. What are you, a Dolphins fan? - No. - John Grogan! - Hey. I'll see you tomorrow. - All right, dude. See you tomorrow.
