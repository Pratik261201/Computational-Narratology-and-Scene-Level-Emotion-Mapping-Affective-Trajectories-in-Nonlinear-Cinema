The question is how you got here and why you've been charged. What do you wanna know? I was about to turn 33. I ran three magazines and a worldwide publishing house.

Hmm. Still there. How about yours? You definitely took my mind off it. Really? Yes! Oh. Julianna here. Hi, Rayna. I missed my audition. I lost my head. No, listen, I have to go. I'm with David. Wrapped in white sheets. Help yourself to whatever you want. Maria will clean up. Set the alarm before you go. And... You are the greatest. Bye, honey! Bye, honey! I'll call you later. Ha, ha. When? -When? -Soon! -Did you reserve the court? -Easy. I can't handle heavy conversation at this ungodly hour. Sorry to do this early, but I gotta be done by 10. You're not gonna make the 8:45, are you? -How did you find me'? -David Aames... you have to check the colours of the letters for the new issue of Rise. -What are the colours? -Yellow and red or the traditional white. -Gotta think about it. -David, please. Don't be late for the 10:00 with the board. Okay, but don't tell anybody where I am. I don't care if God calls. -I'm very, very busy. -But you have... -Yeah. Ha-ha-ha. -Ha-ha-ha. Can't you just get rid of that board? -The Seven Dwarves? No. -Those people drive you nuts. And that was the desire of my father, who hired them. You fucked Julie Gianni again, didn't you? Yeah, I know someone was there when I called. You had that tone. 'Oh, no, man, I got a cold.",

Now, I want answers and I want them now. How's it going? They still look at me as if I was 11 years old. He's going to inherit everything. He gets it all. You're scared of your dreams, aren't you?

No, but I shudder to think what we might have in common. Did you invite the entire Olympic snowboarding team? Today's my birthday. -Say 'happy birthday' to David. -Happy birthday. Welcome to Graceland. Do you have a minute? Happy birthday, you son of a bitch. Happy birthday, David. Happy birthday! Hey! Friends of me! Hello! Let the fun ensue. The living stereo system will be online in a moment. It is the great John Coltrane. They would love an article on it. But if you like it... ...it's an amazing, amazing prototype. No, no, no. That's okay. I've got it. And happy birthday, sir. -Literary god Brian Shelby. -Happy birthday... ...and all the usual shit people say to each other. How you doing? -Living the dream, baby. Living the dream. -David Aames. -And to what do I owe this pleasure? -The pleasure of Sofia Serrano. We met today at the library, if you can believe that. I'm sorry about my coat. It's too big for your closet. -We were both pretending to be intellectuals. -It's amazing. I love your coat. No, I overdressed. I mean, I under-dressed. I'll just continue like you're both actually listening to me. -Do you have another room to put it in? -Danielle? I have ceased to exist. Madison Square Garden is nearby. I think it might fit there. Yes, David. -Happy birthday. -We picked it out together. -Thank you. -We picked it out together. -We... -You're welcome. Stop flirting and open it. -Let's get a drink. -Yes. I'll leave this upstairs. Yeah! Hi. Come here a second. -I'll be right back. -Okay. -Hey, listen... No, no. -Hey, Tommy. No, don't... Don't blow me off. I'm all packed. I'm going back to London... ...and I understand you put me up for that other attorney's job... ...so you didn't have to fire me. That's a classy move... ...and your father would've done the same. -It's okay, Tommy. -No, I... I became incompetent. Is there anything more unbecoming than an ageing mascot, hmm? I cared for your father. I lived and breathed for him... ...but these guys, the Seven Dwarves...",

Who needs ice? -Hey, Emma. -David, happy birthday. You have got the greatest taste in shoes, bar none, anywhere. -I can't believe you remember. -Emma, have you met Lynette? No, but I shudder to think what we might have in common. Did you invite the entire Olympic snowboarding team? Today's my birthday. -Say 'happy birthday' to David. -Happy birthday. Welcome to Graceland. Do you have a minute? Happy birthday, you son of a bitch. Happy birthday, David. Happy birthday! Hey! Friends of me! Hello! Let the fun ensue. The living stereo system will be online in a moment. It is the great John Coltrane. They would love an article on it. But if you like it... ...it's an amazing, amazing prototype. No, no, no. That's okay. I've got it. And happy birthday, sir. -Literary god Brian Shelby. -Happy birthday... ...and all the usual shit people say to each other. How you doing? -Living the dream, baby. Living the dream. -David Aames. -And to what do I owe this pleasure? -The pleasure of Sofia Serrano. We met today at the library, if you can believe that. I'm sorry about my coat. It's too big for your closet. -We were both pretending to be intellectuals. -It's amazing. I love your coat. No, I overdressed. I mean, I under-dressed. I'll just continue like you're both actually listening to me. -Do you have another room to put it in? -Danielle? I have ceased to exist. Madison Square Garden is nearby. I think it might fit there. Yes, David. -Happy birthday. -We picked it out together. -Thank you. -We picked it out together. -We... -You're welcome. Stop flirting and open it. -Let's get a drink. -Yes. I'll leave this upstairs. Yeah! Hi. Come here a second. -I'll be right back. -Okay. -Hey, listen... No, no. -Hey, Tommy. No, don't... Don't blow me off. I'm all packed. I'm going back to London... ...and I understand you put me up for that other attorney's job... ...so you didn't have to fire me. That's a classy move... ...and your father would've done the same. -It's okay, Tommy. -No, I... I became incompetent. Is there anything more unbecoming than an ageing mascot, hmm? I cared for your father. I lived and breathed for him... ...but these guys, the Seven Dwarves..."

Hey, doc, don't get all melancholy over the 30 seconds you were single... ...a long time ago. Heh. That's what you think I'm doing? Oh, yes. You might be right. Let's continue. Time is not our friend. Just our shortcomings. That's all we're allowed to draw? Ha, ha. I've never drawn such a true likeness before. -Mine's finished. -Already? Done. That's how you see me? Maybe I didn't add enough money. No, it's something that you'd see on a wall in a steak house in hell. It's wonderful. Sign it. -Let's see... Let's see yours. -No. -Give me that. -No. I feel bad. You said to draw a caricature. I know. I couldn't. I saw you like that. It's very good. I'll sell it to you. You monster. How much for? One kiss. That smile's gonna be the end of me.

I'm worried. Should I get out some tongs? I'm worried about the dog. No, he's fine. He's just lost a little of his friskiness, that's all. Hey. Sofia? It's David. I'm back in your life, and I... I saw you earlier today. I was just watching our old friend Benny the dog on Conan... ...and I thought of you. Whatever. I, uh... I loved seeing you today. So I will see you soon. You're a great dancer. Whoo! Woo-hoo! -What are you drinking? -Nothing. I'm in the mood for a cheap, sugary, overpriced rum and Coke. Do you want one? Is there any other kind? I'll get us some. -Where's the bathroom? -Uh, it's behind, uh... Over there by the place... By the girl who looks like Bjork. -I'll be right back. -Maybe I should, uh... -Hey, hey, hey. -Hey, man. -You look good. How's your book? -Take it off. No, this is a facial shield. It's an aesthetic prosthesis. These fucking doctors. Take off the mask, man. It's freaking me out. I can't. It's my face. This is my face. Trust me. It's a little different. If you're embarrassed, just go. Nobody asked you to chaperone. -Sofia asked me. -What? She didn't wanna be alone with me? That's bullshit. Because I think I'm being pretty fucking cool about this whole thing. Talk to a shrink. Or are you gonna call me sometime instead of hiding in your apartment? Don't take it out on a girl you only met once. Did she say that? Once? -Did she say that I met her once? -Look, just cut it out, okay? I miss the old you. We all miss the old you. Because the new guy is shit. That came out wrong. I love you. Period. -How's your arm, man? -Fuck you, Brian. How about no sympathy? How about that's the deal we make? Okay? Afrika. Give me a Budweiser and a shot of tequila. What kind of tequila? -What did you say to me? -I said, what kind of tequila? Why don't you ask me to my face, bitch?",

I'm worried. Should I get out some tongs? I'm worried about the dog. No, he's fine. He's just lost a little of his friskiness, that's all. Hey. Sofia? It's David. I'm back in your life, and I... I saw you earlier today. I was just watching our old friend Benny the dog on Conan... ...and I thought of you. Whatever. I, uh... I loved seeing you today. So I will see you soon. You're a great dancer. Whoo! Woo-hoo! -What are you drinking? -Nothing. I'm in the mood for a cheap, sugary, overpriced rum and Coke. Do you want one? Is there any other kind? I'll get us some. -Where's the bathroom? -Uh, it's behind, uh... Over there by the place... By the girl who looks like Bjork. -I'll be right back. -Maybe I should, uh... -Hey, hey, hey. -Hey, man. -You look good. How's your book? -Take it off. No, this is a facial shield. It's an aesthetic prosthesis. These fucking doctors. Take off the mask, man. It's freaking me out. I can't. It's my face. This is my face. Trust me. It's a little different. If you're embarrassed, just go. Nobody asked you to chaperone. -Sofia asked me. -What? She didn't wanna be alone with me? That's bullshit. Because I think I'm being pretty fucking cool about this whole thing. Talk to a shrink. Or are you gonna call me sometime instead of hiding in your apartment? Don't take it out on a girl you only met once. Did she say that? Once? -Did she say that I met her once? -Look, just cut it out, okay? I miss the old you. We all miss the old you. Because the new guy is shit. That came out wrong. I love you. Period. -How's your arm, man? -Fuck you, Brian. How about no sympathy? How about that's the deal we make? Okay? Afrika. Give me a Budweiser and a shot of tequila. What kind of tequila? -What did you say to me? -I said, what kind of tequila? Why don't you ask me to my face, bitch?"

I love you. What is happiness to you, David? For me, it's being here with you. What the fuck is happening? What the fuck is happening? David was a real delight as a child. Oh, God. I'm so afraid of how powerful this is. Oh, David! Red dress, strappy shoes. That is the greatest thing that I've ever heard. In another life, when we are both cats. What's happening? Hey, man, what's happening? I don't wanna see your face! I did it, didn't I? But I don't feel like I killed someone. -David... -I feel like I'm in a dream. Who was the man at the restaurant? Sometimes the mind behaves as if it were in a dream. Faces change. People become other people. The subconscious is a powerful thing. You treated Julie carelessly, didn't you?

        "This is a revolution of the mind. Thank you for the coffee. David. You have been taken. -This is a dream. -Is it? When did you die? When exactly were you... cryonized? Listen to me, for fuck's sake. This is all a very, very professional, very seductive fucking hoax. And if you're just dreaming... look at me. If you're just dreaming right now, that means I don't exist. Are you listening to me or are you just waiting to speak? I'm sorry. I'm just imagining you. David, I am real. I am too real. How do you know? First, I'm smarter than you. And second... Was that a dream? I paid for you to say that. -This is a living dream that I paid for. -I'm fighting for your life here. I paid for this. I didn't kill anyone. -There's no case. -I brought you here. I'm putting my fast-fading prestige on the line. -And I swear to you on my mother's grave... -It's a nightmare. -I wanna find Sofia. -I am real. This is all happening right now. You are going to trial. This isn't a dream. And take off that mask. I don't wanna show my face. Let me see your goddamn face right now. And if you're still disfigured, I'll believe you. -Tech support. -Let me see your face. -What's going on here? -Tech support. Get out here. Your impeccable timing. -Tech support. -Leave now. He's under my jurisdiction. -Tech support! -Get out now. Leave! -Technical support. -David... -Technical... Tech support. Tech... -David, I am your tech support. We're out of time. Take off that mask. Now. Take it off. Yes. Yes. Now, take a look in this mirror and tell me if that isn't your face. You see? Hmm? Huh? You see? Huh? Was I right? God, why do you insist on seeing what is not there? You are perfect. I'm a monster. David, you're handsome. If only I looked like you. Tech support. Please. I, I love the colourful clothes she wears. And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair. I hear the sound of a gentle word I paid for this music. What? I paid for this music. -Can you hear it? -There is no music, David. I'm pickin' up good vibrations. There's no music at all. -I'm pickin' up good vibrations. -Good vibrations. -Hey. -Now where do I go? Tech Support! Hey, Frank. It's a nightmare! Get him out of there.
