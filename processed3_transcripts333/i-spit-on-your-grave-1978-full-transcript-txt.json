Aw, you missed. Playing it safe, huh? Are you ready for this one? Aw, missed. You're not gonna tell me you got that. It's good. Go ahead. Oh, man. You don't even know how to play the game. There it is. I have to show you everything. Feels good to stretch my legs. I've been driving for three straight hours. You came to a nice place. I've rented a summer house here right by the edge of the river. Never even seen it before. Bet you're gonna like it here. I intend to. In fact, I bet you're gonna like it so well you stay year round. Oh no. Just for the summer. Yeah? You're gonna be owing me your life's savings? I'll tell you what, I'll let you go first this time. I got the game. That'll be $5.20. Come on, let's play another game. All right? All right. Start all over. No pushing. Fair game, okay? Okay, five and 20. Thanks. Have a nice summer. I will. You too. Okay. Your order, ma'am. Hi. I thought you'd never find the place. I've been here before. Oh yeah? Yep. I delivered to the tenant here last summer. I know this whole area like them squirrels here. How much do I owe you? $11.25. Where I come from, people aren't that enthusiastic about their place. Where's that? New York City? Mm-hmm. You come from an evil place. You don't say. Here's a tip from an evil New Yorker. I never got a tip like that before. What's your name? Matthew Lucas. What's yours? Jennifer. You can call me Jenny. Hi, Jenny. Do you live here alone? All alone with Mary Selby. Mary? Mary-- is she in there? Mary's right here. She's a fictional name. She's the leading character in a story I'm going to write here. Oh, are you a writer? Mm-hmm. And you're gonna write a book here? My first novel. I've written many short stories. You must be famous. What's your last name? Hills. It's okay if you've never heard of me. All my stories were published in women's magazines. I don't read 'em. Here. Thanks. You got a boyfriend? I have many boyfriends. Could I be your friend? Sure. Any time you need me, you just call me and I'll be here super fast. Bye. Bye, Matthew. Watch out! Hey, look who's coming. Hey, guys. There's a new chick on the Housatonic.",

What's a special broad, Matthew? Miss Hills. Miss Hills is special. Who in the fuck is he talking-- Miss Hills? He means that broad from New York. Aw, he got a peek at her tits and already she's special. She's special. She also gave me a dollar for a tip. New York broads are all loaded, Matthew. Yeah, they fuck around a lot. One day I'm gonna go to New York and fuck all the broads there. I'm gonna do the same in California. Why California? Sunset Strip is just swarming with chicks looking to get laid.

You coax a man into doing it to you, and a man gets the message fast. Now look, whether he's married or not, a man is just a man. Hey, first thing, you come into the gas station and you expose your damn sexy legs to me, walking back and forth real slow, making sure I see 'em good. And then Matthew delivers the food to your door. Come on, he sees half your tits peeking out at him. Tits with no bra. And then, you're lying in the canoe in your bikini, just waiting like bait. Come on, I'll give you a hot bath. How old are your children? Let's see, the girl is 10, and the boy, he's nine already. How do you know about my wife and kids? I wanted you the other day. I came by your place. They were there. You love your children? Sure I do. And your wife? Do you love your wife? She's okay. You get used to a wife after a while, you know? I don't want to talk about my family. Okay. How are your friends? What friends? Your friends. You mean those guys? Shit. They're not my friends. You know, they hang on me like leeches. Fucking goofing off all the time. I really despise people that don't work. Get into trouble too easily, you know? Matthew works. He's okay. Matthew is a half idiot. Hey, you know they called me yesterday from the supermarket asking if I've seen him. Disappeared since yesterday. Took off with his bike somewhere. Nobody knows where or why."
