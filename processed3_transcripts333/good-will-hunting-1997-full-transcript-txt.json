Fuckin' punk! - Oh, what's up? You still tough? - Come on! - You want this? - Ah, come on, come on. That's it. I'd hold you forever here In my arms - Professor Lambeau? - Yes?

I remember you from juvi. How you doing? - What's up, baby? What you doing? Ah, yeah, sorry about that. Um... I was wonderin' maybe we could get together, um, sometime this week. You know, sit out at a cafe. Maybe have some caramels. - Oh, that sounds wonderful. - Yeah? Yeah. Sure. Where are you? Um, well, actually, this is, uh, this is just a shot in the dark... but, uh, there's no chance that you're, uh, pre-law, is there? - Have a seat. - Thank you. Nice talking to ya. What the fuck do you want? I'm Gerald Lambeau. The professor you told to fuck himself. Well, what the fuck do you want? I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed to release you under my supervision."

Do you think I'd know the first thing about how hard your life has been... how you feel, who you are... because I read Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate you? Personally, I don't give a shit about all that. Because you know what? I can't learn anything from you I can't read in some fuckin' book. Unless you want to talk about you, who you are. Then I'm fascinated. I'm in. But you don't wanna do that, do you, sport? You're terrified of what you might say. Your move, chief. Hello? Hello? Hello? Professor Valenti, are you calling me again?

But we all heard this one. Go ahead, just say it anyway. Go ahead. I will go ahead. Thanks a lot. Guess I have the floor now. Um, yeah, my Uncle Marty's drivin' home, right? Bombed out of his tree, right? Just hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked! This state trooper, uh, sees him and pulls him over. So my uncle's fucked, basically. Got him out of the car, and tried to make him walk the line. He gets out of the car, you know, pukes and the guy statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit. So, he's about to throw the cuffs on him and put him in jail. All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road there's this huge fuckin' boom, right? - So statie gets real spooked, and he turns around... - He got shot? - No, no. - So, so... - You've heard this story before. - Yeah, Morgan, stop it. Stop it. Some other guy's car had hit a tree. Okay? There was an accident. - Anyway... Shut the fuck up! - How could he hear the other car accident if it wasn't right behind him? - I'm gonna break your neck. - You're driving him nuts, Morgan."

I got... - Who? - I got plenty. - Well, name 'em. Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost, O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke... - That's great. They're all dead. - Not to me they're not. Nah. You don't have a lot of dialogue with them. You can't give back to them, Will. Not without some serious smelling salts and a heater. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world... where you're always afraid to take the first step... because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road. - You gonna take the professor's side on this? - Don't give me a line of shit. - No. - Look, I didn't want the job. It's not about the job. I don't care if you work for the government. But you can do anything you want. You are bound by nothing. What are you passionate about? What do you want? I mean, there are guys who work their entire life layin' brick... so their kids have a chance at the opportunities you have here. - I didn't ask for this. - No. You were born with it, so don't cop out behind, \"I didn't ask for this. \" What do you mean, \"cop out\"? I mean, w- w-what's wrong with layin' brick? - Nothin'. - There's nothin' wrong with it. That's, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Right. My day laid brick, okay? Busted his ass so I could have an education. Exactly. That's an honourable profession. What's wrong with, with fixin' somebody's car? Someone will get to work the next day because of me. There's honour in that. Yeah, there is, Will. There's honour in that. And there's honour in... you know, taking that 40-minute train ride... so those college kids could come in in the morning and the floors are clean. And the wastebaskets are empty. That's real work. - That's right. - Right. And that's honourable. Sure, that's why you took that job. I mean, for the honour of it. I just have a little question here. You could be a janitor anywhere. Why did you work at the most prestigious technical college in the whole fuckin' world?"

That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay, Sean. And if you're angry at me for being, being successful, for being what you could have been, Sean... - I'm not angry at you, Gerry. - Oh, yes, you're angry at me, Sean. You resent me. But I'm not gonna apologize for any, any success I've had."
