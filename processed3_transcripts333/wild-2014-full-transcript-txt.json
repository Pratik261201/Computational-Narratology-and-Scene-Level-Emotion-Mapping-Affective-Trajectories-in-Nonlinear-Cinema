      "raw_text": "Thank you. Good meal. So, your husband, the two of you meet in college? - Your husband. - Oh, Paul? - Yeah. - Yes. Yeah. Well, he must be crazy. It's one thing for a man to take off on a hike like that, but to allow your wife to do it? Whole other thing entirely. Not everyone in the world thinks like you do, Frank. Nope, that's why everything is so messed up. Paul and I kind of do our own thing. Don't you get any ideas. How could I possibly? You gonna take off with her? You have an extra tent? You'd be yelling for me to come get you before you got to the end of the driveway. This is really good. Baby, baby, be my friend So, what does this tattoo mean to you guys, anyways? Well, we both just really dig horses. We're getting divorced today and we thought we should do something that bonded us together. Oh. Okay. It hasn't occurred to you guys that it might be easier just to stay married? Cheaper, too. At least we probably won't regret it. Couples don't necessarily stay married, but they tend to stay divorced. You get a lot of people asking you about removing tattoos? Well, sometimes. I cheated on him. It happens. She seems sorry. I am sorry. Cheryl, come on, can we just... Come on, man, wipe the slate clean. It's quite a big slate. I cheated on him a lot of times. Is that right? \"Stryed\"? No, it's \"strayed.\" Like a stray dog. The form asked me what my new last name would be. I... I looked it up. It just sounded right. You're all set. You're going to have to mail them yourselves. It's been a wonderful and crazy seven years. Goodbye, Cheryl Strayed. Got what you needed? Yes. Now I don't have to eat cold mush anymore. I can eat hot mush. There's no husband, is there? No. I mean, there was, but he's in Minneapolis, not on the PCT. I said that 'cause I was scared of you. Yeah, I knew that. Can't say I blame you. Do you ever think about quitting? Oh, only once every two minutes or so. Everything hurts. All the time. - You think I should quit? - Yes, I do. Don't listen to me. Hell, I've quit a bunch of stuff. Quit jobs, quit marriages. I'd have quit that hike after the first day. You regret any of them? I didn't have a choice. I just couldn't do them no more. Never been a time when there was a fork in my road. Yeah. That's about the size of it. Be careful.",

        "Thank you. Good meal. So, your husband, the two of you meet in college? - Your husband. - Oh, Paul? - Yeah. - Yes. Yeah. Well, he must be crazy. It's one thing for a man to take off on a hike like that, but to allow your wife to do it? Whole other thing entirely. Not everyone in the world thinks like you do, Frank. Nope, that's why everything is so messed up. Paul and I kind of do our own thing. Don't you get any ideas. How could I possibly? You gonna take off with her? You have an extra tent? You'd be yelling for me to come get you before you got to the end of the driveway. This is really good. Baby, baby, be my friend So, what does this tattoo mean to you guys, anyways? Well, we both just really dig horses. We're getting divorced today and we thought we should do something that bonded us together. Oh. Okay. It hasn't occurred to you guys that it might be easier just to stay married? Cheaper, too. At least we probably won't regret it. Couples don't necessarily stay married, but they tend to stay divorced. You get a lot of people asking you about removing tattoos? Well, sometimes. I cheated on him. It happens. She seems sorry. I am sorry. Cheryl, come on, can we just... Come on, man, wipe the slate clean. It's quite a big slate. I cheated on him a lot of times. Is that right? \"Stryed\"? No, it's \"strayed.\" Like a stray dog. The form asked me what my new last name would be. I... I looked it up. It just sounded right. You're all set. You're going to have to mail them yourselves. It's been a wonderful and crazy seven years. Goodbye, Cheryl Strayed. Got what you needed? Yes. Now I don't have to eat cold mush anymore. I can eat hot mush. There's no husband, is there? No. I mean, there was, but he's in Minneapolis, not on the PCT. I said that 'cause I was scared of you. Yeah, I knew that. Can't say I blame you. Do you ever think about quitting? Oh, only once every two minutes or so. Everything hurts. All the time. - You think I should quit? - Yes, I do. Don't listen to me. Hell, I've quit a bunch of stuff. Quit jobs, quit marriages. I'd have quit that hike after the first day. You regret any of them? I didn't have a choice. I just couldn't do them no more. Never been a time when there was a fork in my road. Yeah. That's about the size of it. Be careful."

I'm not \"on the road.\" I'm hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. I just had to bypass a chunk of it because there was a snowfall this year. Okay, so if you're not a hobo, where do you live? I'm between places right now. I'm probably going to live in Portland when I get off the PCT. This is so fucking cool. I mean... I've only spoken to maybe one other female hobo in two years. Let me reiterate to you, I am not a hobo. And that's probably because women cannot walk out of their lives. They've got kids to take care of, they've got parents to look after. You sound like a feminist. I am. That's excellent. That's fantastic. I love feminists. So you're trying to tell me you're not a hobo, so that means you have a job then, right? I've had a whole lot of different jobs. Up until a couple of years ago, I was studying. I hope you don't think this is too personal, but I've noticed it's often personal trauma that forces people out of their life and into the hobo life.",

There's nothing I don't get, believe me. But then what? Cheryl, if there's one thing I could teach you... It's how to find your best self. And when you do, how to hold onto it for dear life. And this is your best self. I'm trying. Do I regret marrying an abusive alcoholic asshole? No. Not for a second. Because I got you. And your brother. See how it works? It isn't easy... But it's worth it. There's going to be a lot worse days than this. And you can let them kill you... But, I don't know... I want to live. \"I want to live.\" You couldn't even stick around and enjoy your miserable happy life. I think you have packages for me? My name is Cheryl Strayed. New boots from REI? Yes. How far did you walk in those? About 50 miles. You sure there's not another package? I'm sure. And, lady, if you walked 50 miles in duct tape, you got the right package. It's two bucks for the Snapple. I'll pass. Thanks. You like my shoes? Dearest Cheryl, you made it halfway. Six-hundred miles. Damn! I ran into Aimee. She said you were making your hike longer. Did you decide where you'll finish? Let me know, I'll send a tube of foot cream. I'm sorry if I cut you short on the phone before you left. I still resent you, I guess. The funny thing is... hell, I'll admit it... I miss you. Be sure to take plenty of water with you for the trail. There's a water tank 20 miles up, right? Yep. But it's way over 100 degrees out there. That's a lot of sweat. Okay. Thanks. Howdy. You should have something for Stacey Johnson. I'll go check. Hey, are you hiking the PCT? Yeah. Are you? You're a woman! You come across a guy named Greg? Yeah. A while ago, at Kennedy Meadows... when I knew even less than I do now. Well, he quit. What? Greg? He couldn't deal with the snow. He's coming back next year. Wow. Greg quit and I'm still here? Cheers to that. You get lonely? Honestly, I think I'm lonelier in my real life than out here. Yes, I miss my friends, of course, but... it's not like anybody's waiting for me at home. How about you? Why are you here? I don't know. I just need to find something in myself, you know? I think the trail is good for that. I mean, look.",

Love and kisses, Aimee. As it were your own It's a hand-me-down The thoughts are broken Perhaps they're better Left unsung I don't know I don't really care Do I know you? Thanks. Let there be song To fill the air Ripple in still water When there is no pebble tossed Nor wind to blow Dear Paul, I woke up this morning and wrote your name in the sand. I've done that on every beach I've been on ever since I met you. But I'm not going to do it again. I'm ready to move on. Baby, baby, be my friend I have only another 300 miles left to walk. I'm desperate for it to be over. But I'm terrified, too. When I'm done... I'll only have two dimes to my name. But I'll have to start living. And I'm nowhere near ready. Please! Sir, wait! I just closed. I think you have a package for me in there? Could it wait until tomorrow? It has fresh clothes and food, and batteries I need. Okay. If you'll have a drink with me later. Sure. There you go, good-looking. Thanks. You like punch? I make a good one. I throw every liquor I can find into a bucket and I pour a couple of cans of juice on top. Sounds good. - Cheryl? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. - We're closed, guys. - \"If your nerve deny you... - \"...go above your nerve.\" - Emily Dickinson. - Yes. \"I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep.\" Walt Whitman? No, that was Robert Frost. The Whitman was, \"Be curious, not judgmental.\" Yes. \"God is a ruthless bitch.\" You left the name off. - That one was me. - You're our hero. Okay, fellas, I'm shutting up now. We just wanted to pick up our post? No. I'm sorry. I already reopened for the young lady here. And I'm not gonna reopen again. But you wouldn't really have to reopen because you haven't closed yet. And their packages are right there. It's such a miserable night. Whatever's in them is gonna make the night just that much better. Do you mind? That your horse? If you want to take her out in the morning, she could do with it. Hey, so the campsite, is it left?",

Enjoy some well-deserved rest, but don't overdo it, okay? Still a lot to hike, no? I had said you can quit anytime. But I take it back. Call me when you get to the finish line. Love and kisses, Aimee. As it were your own It's a hand-me-down The thoughts are broken Perhaps they're better Left unsung I don't know I don't really care Do I know you? Thanks. Let there be song To fill the air Ripple in still water When there is no pebble tossed Nor wind to blow Dear Paul, I woke up this morning and wrote your name in the sand. I've done that on every beach I've been on ever since I met you. But I'm not going to do it again. I'm ready to move on. Baby, baby, be my friend I have only another 300 miles left to walk. I'm desperate for it to be over. But I'm terrified, too. When I'm done... I'll only have two dimes to my name. But I'll have to start living. And I'm nowhere near ready. Please! Sir, wait! I just closed. I think you have a package for me in there? Could it wait until tomorrow? It has fresh clothes and food, and batteries I need. Okay. If you'll have a drink with me later. Sure. There you go, good-looking. Thanks. You like punch? I make a good one. I throw every liquor I can find into a bucket and I pour a couple of cans of juice on top. Sounds good. - Cheryl? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. - We're closed, guys. - \"If your nerve deny you... - \"...go above your nerve.\" - Emily Dickinson. - Yes. \"I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep.\" Walt Whitman? No, that was Robert Frost. The Whitman was, \"Be curious, not judgmental.\" Yes. \"God is a ruthless bitch.\" You left the name off. - That one was me. - You're our hero. Okay, fellas, I'm shutting up now. We just wanted to pick up our post? No. I'm sorry. I already reopened for the young lady here. And I'm not gonna reopen again. But you wouldn't really have to reopen because you haven't closed yet. And their packages are right there. It's such a miserable night. Whatever's in them is gonna make the night just that much better. Do you mind? That your horse? If you want to take her out in the morning, she could do with it. Hey, so the campsite, is it left?"
