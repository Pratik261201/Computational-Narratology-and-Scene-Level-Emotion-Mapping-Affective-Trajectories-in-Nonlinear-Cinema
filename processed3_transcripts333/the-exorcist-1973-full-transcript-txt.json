No, you don't. I do it all the time. Oh, yeah? Well, let's both play with it. You really don't want me to play, huh? No, I do. Captain Howdy said no. - Captain who? - Captain Howdy. Who's Captain Howdy? You know. I make the questions and he does the answers. - Oh, Captain Howdy. Yeah, I see. - He's nice. Oh, I'll bet he is. - Here, I'll show you. - All right. Captain Howdy, do you think my mum's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice. - Well, maybe he's sleeping. - You think? Regan, why are you reading that stuff? Because I like it. It's not even a good picture of you. Look at that. - You look so mature. - I wouldn't talk. You wouldn't talk? Well, I didn't know they were taking it. I didn't have my make-up man there. Let me take an eyelash off your face. Okay. No, I didn't get it. What are we gonna do on your birthday? Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year? No work? What can we do? I don't know. Well, what would you like to do? Got any ideas? Let me think. Let me think. What can we do? Hey, we never finished seeing all the sights in Washington. Didn't get to Lee Mansion and lots of stuff. Shall we do that? Go sightseeing? If it's a nice day? - Yeah, let's do that. - Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie. Okay? Oh, I love you. I love you, Rags. We'll have a good day, yeah? You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like. Mr. Dennings? Well, you know, it's okay. Well, thank you very much... but why on earth would I wanna bring Burke on your birthday? Well, you like him. Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him? Hey, what's going on? What is this? You're gonna marry him, aren't you? Oh, my God. Are you kidding? - What? - Me marry Burke Dennings? Don't be silly. Of course not. Where did you ever get an idea like that? But you like him. Of course I like him. I like pizzas too, but I'm not gonna marry one. You don't like him like Daddy? Regan, I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy, honey. Okay? Burke just comes around here a lot, because... well, he's lonely. He don't got nothing to do. Well, I heard differently. Oh, you did? What did you hear, huh? - I don't know. I just thought. - Come on. What did you hear? Well, you didn't think so good. - How do you know? Ha, ha. - Ha-ha-ha. Because Burke and I are just friends. Okay? Really. Okay. You ready for sleep? - Good night. - Good night, honey. ♪ Lord, I was born a rambling man ♪ ♪ Lord, I was born a rambling man ♪ It's my mother, Tom. She's alone. I never should have left her.

Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin seems to work to relieve the condition. And as to how or why, we really don't know. But, her symptoms could be overreaction to depression. That's out of my field. My daughter isn't depressed. Well, you mentioned her father and the separation. You think I should take her to a psychiatrist? No. I think we should wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. - Okay. - Let's wait two, three weeks. All right. And the lies she's been telling? That's part of it, huh? Lies? Like saying her bed's shaking. That stuff. Have you ever known your daughter to swear? - To use obscenities? - No, never. Interesting.

No. I think the best explanation is always the simplest. Well, we'll wait. We'll wait and see. Yeah. So in the meantime... try not to worry. How? The oedema affected her brain, you understand? She don't let no doctor come near her. She was all the time screaming, talking to the radio. You should've called me when it happened. Listen. Regular hospital not gonna put up with that.

No. I tell fortunes by reading the creases. Now, shut up and go to sleep. Good night. Stealing is a sin."

      "raw_text": "Keep away. The sow is mine. Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me. Stay away from me. Stay away. Hold her steady. Hold her tight. Don't let them. She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow. What was going on in there? How could she fly off the bed like that? Pathological states can induce abnormal strength... accelerated motor performance. For example... say a 90-pound woman sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck... runs out and lifts the wheels a half a foot up off the ground. You've heard the story. Same thing here. Same principle, I mean. So, what's wrong with her? We still think that the temporal lobe... Oh, what are you talking about, for Christ's sakes? Did you see her or not? She's acting like she's fucking out of her mind. Psychotic, like a split personality, or... Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. There haven't been more than 100 authentic cases... of so-called \"split personality,\" Mrs. MacNeil. Now, I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry... but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first. So, what's next? A pneumoencephalogram, I would think, to pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal. Oh, Christ. Well, what we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram... could conceivably turn up there. At least it would eliminate certain other possibilities. Dr. Taney says the x-rays are negative. In other words, normal. You keep any drugs in your house? No, of course not. Nothing like that. Are you sure? Well, of course, I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass. Are you planning to be home soon? I mean, to L.A., I mean. No, I... I'm building a new house. My old one has been sold. I don't know. I was gonna take... I was gonna take Regan to Europe for a while after she finished school. Why do you ask? I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist. Hello? Sharon? Shit. God. Sharon. What do you mean, leaving Regan by herself? Her window's wide open. The room is freezing. - Didn't he tell you? - Who? - Burke is... - What's Burke got to do with it? Nobody was here. When I went to get the Thorazine... - I had him stay with her, and... - Oh. I should have known better. Sorry. I guess you should have. How were the tests? We have to start looking for a shrink. Hi, Chuck. Come on in. I suppose you heard. Heard what? You haven't heard. Burke's dead. He must have been drunk. He fell from the top of the steps right outside. By the time he hit M Street, he broke his neck. Oh, God. No. Yeah, I know. Sharon... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. When I touch your forehead, open your eyes. Are you comfortable, Regan? Yes. How old are you? Twelve. Is there someone inside you? Sometimes. Who is it? I don't know. Is it Captain Howdy? I don't know. If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer? No. Why not? I'm afraid. If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you? Yes. I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now. If you are there, you, too, are hypnotised and must answer all my questions. Come forward... and answer me now. Are you the person inside of Regan? Who are you? - Help me. - Let go. Father Karras? Have we met? No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell. That you look like a boxer. William F. Kinderman. Homicide. What's this all about? It's true. You do look like a boxer. Like John Garfield in Body and soul. Exactly. John Garfield. People tell you that, Father? Do people tell you you look like Paul Newman? Always. Well, you know this director who was doing the film here... Burke Dennings? I've seen him. You've seen him. You're also familiar how last week he died? Only what I read in the papers. Father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting. I once did a paper on it. Really? From the psychiatric end. I know. I read it. All of this desecration in the church... do you think this has anything to do with witchcraft? Maybe. Some rituals used in the black mass, maybe. And now Dennings. You read how he died? In a fall. Let me tell you how. And please, Father... confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father... was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M Street... with his head turned completely around... facing backwards. Didn't happen in the fall? It's possible. - Possible, however... - Unlikely. Exactly. So on the one hand, we've got a witchcraft kind of murder... and on the other hand, a black mass-type desecration in the church. You think the killer and the desecrater are the same? Maybe somebody crazy... somebody with a spite against the Church. Some unconscious rebellion. A sick priest, is that it? Look, Father, this is hard for you. Please, I understand... but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist. You'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean, this kind of sickness, you'd know that. I don't know anyone who fits that description. Ah. Doctor's ethics. If you knew, you wouldn't tell, huh? No, I probably wouldn't. Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist... in sunny California, no less... was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient. Is that a threat? No, I mention it only in passing. Incidentally, I mention it only in passing... I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession. Hey, Father, wait a minute. - Do you like movies? - Very much. Well, I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K, though, you know, she gets tired, never likes to go. - That's too bad. - Yeah, I hate to go alone. I love to talk film... discuss, to critique. You want to see a film with me? I got passes to the Crest. It's Othello. - Who's in it? - Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You happy? - I've seen it. - Ah. One last time. You can think of some priest who fits the bill? Come on. No, answer the question, Father Paranoia. All right. All right. You know who I think really did it? Who? The Dominicans. Go pick on them. I could have you deported, you know that? I lied. You look like Sal Mineo. It looks like a type of disorder that's, rarely ever seen anymore... except in primitive cultures. We call it, somnambular-form possession. Quite frankly, we really don't know much about it at all... except that it starts with a conflict or a guilt... and it leads to the patient's delusions that his body has been invaded... by some alien intelligence... A spirit, if you will. Look, I'm telling you again, and you'd better believe me... I am not going to lock her up in some goddamn asylum. Well, it's out of... And I don't care what you call it. I'm not putting her away. Well, I'm sorry. You're sorry? Jesus Christ. Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can tell me with all your bullshit is... Of course, there is one outside chance for a cure. But, I think of it as a shock treatment. As I said, it's a very outside chance... Would you just name it, for God's sakes? What is it? Do you have any religious beliefs? No. What about your daughter? No. Why? Have you ever heard of exorcism? Well, it's a stylised ritual... in which the, rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's been pretty much discarded these days... except by the Catholics, who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. But it, has worked, in fact... although not for the reasons they think, of course. It's purely force of suggestion. The... The victim's belief in possession is what helped cause it... so in that same way... the belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear. You're telling me that I should take my daughter to a witch doctor. Is that it? Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom? She's going to be well? Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me. Now, did you? No, not me. I didn't. This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there? Of course, I didn't. I didn't put it. - Excuse me, madam. - What? - A man to see you. - What man? Might your daughter remember, perhaps... if Mr. Dennings was in her room that night? - Why do you ask? - Mm. Might she remember? No, she was heavily sedated. It's serious? Yes, I'm afraid it is. - May I ask...? - We still don't know. Watch out for draughts. A draught in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria. Excuse me, madam. Anything else? No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you. It's all right, Karl. Why are you asking all this? It's strange. The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes... and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil... it isn't likely he would fall from a window. Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found. Except maybe one chance in a thousand. No. My hunch... My opinion... point one. Point two... plus the various other things we mentioned... would make it very probable... probable, not certain... that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be? It could be one way. If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left... and the time you returned. Judas Priest, just a second. The servants? They have visitors? Not at all. You were expecting a package that day, some delivery? Not that I know of. Groceries, cleaning, a package? I really wouldn't know. See, Karl takes care of all that. I see. Would you like to ask him? No, never mind, it's... It's very remote. No, never mind. Yeah. Would you like some more coffee? Please. That's cute. Your daughter, she's the artist? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Incidentally... you might ask your daughter... if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night. Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room. Oh, I know, I realise... but if certain British doctors never asked, \"What is this fungus?.\" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct? Well, when she's better, I'll ask her. - Yeah, couldn't hurt. - Okay. In the meantime... That's okay. I really hate to ask you this, but... What? For my daughter, could you please give an autograph? Of course. Where's a pencil? Right here. Here. Oh. She'd love it. And what's her name? I lied. It's for me. - Kinderman. - Okay. You know that film you made, Angel? - Oh, yeah. - I saw that six times. - Really? - It was beautiful. Ha, ha. Thank you. You're a very nice lady. - Thank you. - You're a nice man. I'll come back when she's feeling better. - Bye. - Bye. Please, no. - Do it. - Please, don't. You bitch. Do it. Do it. Please, no. REGAN",

Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist... in sunny California, no less... was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient. Is that a threat? No, I mention it only in passing. Incidentally, I mention it only in passing... I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession. Hey, Father, wait a minute. - Do you like movies? - Very much. Well, I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K, though, you know, she gets tired, never likes to go. - That's too bad. - Yeah, I hate to go alone. I love to talk film... discuss, to critique. You want to see a film with me? I got passes to the Crest. It's Othello. - Who's in it? - Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You happy? - I've seen it. - Ah. One last time. You can think of some priest who fits the bill? Come on. No, answer the question, Father Paranoia. All right. All right. You know who I think really did it? Who? The Dominicans. Go pick on them. I could have you deported, you know that? I lied. You look like Sal Mineo. It looks like a type of disorder that's, rarely ever seen anymore... except in primitive cultures. We call it, somnambular-form possession. Quite frankly, we really don't know much about it at all... except that it starts with a conflict or a guilt... and it leads to the patient's delusions that his body has been invaded... by some alien intelligence... A spirit, if you will. Look, I'm telling you again, and you'd better believe me... I am not going to lock her up in some goddamn asylum. Well, it's out of... And I don't care what you call it. I'm not putting her away. Well, I'm sorry. You're sorry? Jesus Christ. Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can tell me with all your bullshit is... Of course, there is one outside chance for a cure. But, I think of it as a shock treatment. As I said, it's a very outside chance... Would you just name it, for God's sakes? What is it? Do you have any religious beliefs? No. What about your daughter? No. Why? Have you ever heard of exorcism? Well, it's a stylised ritual... in which the, rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's been pretty much discarded these days... except by the Catholics, who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. But it, has worked, in fact... although not for the reasons they think, of course. It's purely force of suggestion. The... The victim's belief in possession is what helped cause it... so in that same way... the belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear. You're telling me that I should take my daughter to a witch doctor. Is that it? Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom? She's going to be well? Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me. Now, did you? No, not me. I didn't. This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there? Of course, I didn't. I didn't put it. - Excuse me, madam. - What? - A man to see you. - What man? Might your daughter remember, perhaps... if Mr. Dennings was in her room that night? - Why do you ask? - Mm. Might she remember? No, she was heavily sedated. It's serious? Yes, I'm afraid it is. - May I ask...? - We still don't know. Watch out for draughts. A draught in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria. Excuse me, madam. Anything else? No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you. It's all right, Karl. Why are you asking all this? It's strange. The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes... and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil... it isn't likely he would fall from a window. Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found. Except maybe one chance in a thousand. No. My hunch... My opinion... point one. Point two... plus the various other things we mentioned... would make it very probable... probable, not certain... that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be? It could be one way. If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left... and the time you returned. Judas Priest, just a second. The servants? They have visitors? Not at all. You were expecting a package that day, some delivery? Not that I know of. Groceries, cleaning, a package? I really wouldn't know. See, Karl takes care of all that. I see. Would you like to ask him? No, never mind, it's... It's very remote. No, never mind. Yeah. Would you like some more coffee? Please. That's cute. Your daughter, she's the artist? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Incidentally... you might ask your daughter... if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night. Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room. Oh, I know, I realise... but if certain British doctors never asked, \"What is this fungus?.\" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct? Well, when she's better, I'll ask her. - Yeah, couldn't hurt. - Okay. In the meantime... That's okay. I really hate to ask you this, but... What? For my daughter, could you please give an autograph? Of course. Where's a pencil? Right here. Here. Oh. She'd love it. And what's her name? I lied. It's for me. - Kinderman. - Okay. You know that film you made, Angel? - Oh, yeah. - I saw that six times. - Really? - It was beautiful. Ha, ha. Thank you. You're a very nice lady. - Thank you. - You're a nice man. I'll come back when she's feeling better. - Bye. - Bye. Please, no. - Do it. - Please, don't. You bitch. Do it. Do it. Please, no. REGAN"

I thought you were supposed to be an expert. There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession as most priests. Look, your daughter doesn't say she's a demon. She says she's the devil himself. If you've seen as many psychotics as I have... you'd realise that's the same thing as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You asked me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months under observation in the best hospital you can find. You show me Regan's double... same face, same voice, everything... and I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut. I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter. I want you to tell me that you know for a fact... that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind. Tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good. You tell me that. Did Regan know a priest was coming over? No. Did you know my mother died recently? - Yes, I did. I'm very sorry. - No. Is Regan aware of it? Not at all. Why do you ask? It's not important. Good night. Hello? - Here, take it and just don't... - Okay.. Hello, Daddy? This is me. - What should I say? I don't know. - Just talk to your daddy. - Anything you want. - All right... Tell him what you've been doing and how you're feeling and like that. Well, you see... I mean, I hope you can hear me. Can you hear me okay? - Well, let me see. - He's not gonna answer you. Ha-ha-ha. Go on. Talk to your daddy, honey. I don't know what to say, though. Well, let's see. First we... No. - Wait. I don't know. - Come on, Regan. - Tell him about Washington. - Okay. See, we're in Washington now, Daddy, and... He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said: \"Take this, all of you, and eat it... for this is my body.\" When the supper was ended, he took the cup. Again he gave you thanks and praise.

Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway. What about the exorcist? Have you any ideas? How about Lankester Merrin? Merrin? I had a notion he was in Iraq. I read he was working on a dig near Nineveh. You're right, but he's finished. He came back three or four months ago. He's at Woodstock now. What's he doing there, teaching? He's working on another book. Don't you think he's too old, Tom? How's his health? He must be all right. He's still running around digging up tombs. Mm. - Besides, he's had experience. - I didn't know that. Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted months. I heard it damn near killed him. Father? - You're Mrs. MacNeil? - Yes. I'm Father Merrin. - Come in. - Thank you. - Is Father Karras here? - Yes. - He's here already. - Father? Father Karras. It's an honour to meet you, Father. - Are you very tired? - No. I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence, Damien... and gather up a cassock for myself... two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water... and... your copy of The Roman Ritual. The large one. I believe we should begin. Do you want to hear the background of the case first? Why? This is yours to do with as you please. You can choose to escape, if you want, but you may never be able to return. Don't let anyone decide for you. Hail Mary, full of grace... - Excuse me. - Thank you. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Would you like some brandy in that, Father? Well, the doctors say I shouldn't. But thank God... my will is weak. Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon. We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He's a liar. The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth... to attack us. The attack is psychological, Damien. And powerful. So don't listen. Remember that. Do not listen. It might be helpful if I gave you some background... on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, I'd say there seem to be three. - She's convinced that she's... - There is only one. What is your daughter's middle name, Mrs. MacNeil? Teresa. What a lovely name.",

He's at Woodstock now. What's he doing there, teaching? He's working on another book. Don't you think he's too old, Tom? How's his health? He must be all right. He's still running around digging up tombs. Mm. - Besides, he's had experience. - I didn't know that. Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted months. I heard it damn near killed him. Father? - You're Mrs. MacNeil? - Yes. I'm Father Merrin. - Come in. - Thank you. - Is Father Karras here? - Yes. - He's here already. - Father? Father Karras. It's an honour to meet you, Father. - Are you very tired? - No. I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence, Damien... and gather up a cassock for myself... two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water... and... your copy of The Roman Ritual. The large one. I believe we should begin. Do you want to hear the background of the case first? Why? This is yours to do with as you please. You can choose to escape, if you want, but you may never be able to return. Don't let anyone decide for you. Hail Mary, full of grace... - Excuse me. - Thank you. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Would you like some brandy in that, Father? Well, the doctors say I shouldn't. But thank God... my will is weak. Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon. We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He's a liar. The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth... to attack us. The attack is psychological, Damien. And powerful. So don't listen. Remember that. Do not listen. It might be helpful if I gave you some background... on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, I'd say there seem to be three. - She's convinced that she's... - There is only one. What is your daughter's middle name, Mrs. MacNeil? Teresa. What a lovely name."

Bye. - Bye, Father. - I hope I see you again. I hope so too. Father Dyer? I thought you'd like to keep this. Why don't you keep it? Lieutenant. You just missed them. How's the girl? She seemed fine. That's important. Well, well... back to business, back to work. - Goodbye, Father. - Goodbye. Father Dyer... do you go to films? Sure. Well, I got passes. In fact, I got a pass to the Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go? - What's playing? - Wuthering Heights. Who's in it? Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball. I've seen it. Another one. - Had your lunch? - No.",
