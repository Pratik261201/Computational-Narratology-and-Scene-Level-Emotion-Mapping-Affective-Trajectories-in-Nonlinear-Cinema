Send it off to a certain plump guy in a red suit and, provided you've kept your act together more or less, he'll drop off a toy or two. And yet, no one seems to wonder how the whole thing got started in the first place. This is a story about letters, and it began... with this one. ...74, 75, 76... ...77, 78, 79, - 80! - Drill Sergeant, sir! All the way from the top! Dispatch for one of your cadets! It's for him, sir. Cadet Johanssen! Mmm-mmm-mmm! Stop. Don't tell me. Let me try to guess. I give up. Who are you? Sarge! Drill Sarge! Have a seat. Can I get you something to drink? An espresso? A cappuccino? Aren't you supposed to be in equestrian training? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. No worries. I've got someone covering for me. Dispatch from the Postmaster General's Office! What? Sarge, is that for real? Don't tease me now. Here, hold these. Ah, well, I was expecting this a little bit sooner, but, yup, summoned to the dragon's lair. Go ahead and cancel the Drill Sergeant's espresso, actually. And, uh, here, why don't you finish mine? I'm not gonna be needing it anymore... ...and I'm gonna take one last look around the old place so I can forget it. Mmm-hmm. Got it. All right, let's go. Nine months. It's been nine months since I used every ounce of my influence to get you into the Royal Postal Academy. Actually, nine months and six days, but who's counting? What? No croutons? Oh, man, come on! Shall we take account of your progress then? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Definitely. - Sergeant. - Yes, sir! Sorting and filing: total failure. Carrier pigeon care and handling... ...abysmal performance. Transport of fragile merchandise... ...worst on record. Well, there you have it. But, hey, we gave it the old college try, didn't we? Guess I'll just go pack up and head home then. Too bad. Darn, oh, darn. - Stay right where you are. - No, Dad! You're right. When will I grow up? When will I stop squandering all these opportunities, which you so kindly forced me into, and become my own man? I guess I must really hanker down and rethink my priorities. All wrapped up in my silk sheets with some caviar and a sherry... You still buy the same brand, right? You think I'm just going to watch you purposely fail and then let you waltz right back to a privileged life void of any purpose or meaning?",

Smeerensburg. Which is on an island, which is surrounded by water, which I need a boat to get to, which you have. Are we starting to connect the dots? Is the weather always like this? Eh. We're having a bit of a heat wave. Huh? There she is. Smeerensburg. Charming, huh? Why, you should see it in the spring. That's when those grays really pop. What happened here? Oh!

I knew I was forgetting something! Children! Thank you! You're the teacher? Okay, here's how it works. I sell fish, and then the person on the other side of the counter... - That would be you. You buy... - Holy moly! That's you? What happened? - What happened was... - That's... That came out wrong. I took a teaching job at a place where people don't send their kids to school! Mingling with their sworn enemy's spawn? Oh, no! We can't have that! So, now I'm reduced to doing this so I can get some money and start fresh somewhere far, far away from here. Are you going to buy something? Herring's on sale today. Ah! There you are. I wondered where you'd scurried off to! Morning, Miss. Alva. - Mogens. - Come on, sport! I saved the best for last! Home sweet home. Ow! What the... - Mail that, postman! - Now wait a minute, that's completely... Go home, you loser! Oh, yeah? Well, if I'm a loser, then you're a, uh... You're too far. You're gone. Well, lots of nice, natural light, rustic touches, central air and panoramic views. Perfect for animal lovers. - Enjoy. - Wait! Wait! This can't be right! I... Oh, I get it. Did my father put you up to this? Good one. Ha ha. You got me. Okay, well, enough of that. Show me where I'm really staying. I'd like a hot bath and a look at the dinner menu. Here, let me help you out. You're a postman in Smeerensburg, which is on an island cut off from the world, frigid cold, angry, violent neighbors, and this is home now. Are we starting to connect the dots? Aah! Ugh. Almost. Hang in there. What? Hmm? Oh. Aah! That's it! This place is the worst! I'm going home! No! You can't leave, remember? You'll be broke! Out in the streets! But I hate it here! It's so cold and icky! And the people are mean to me. And I miss my silk sheets. Shut up! Stop being weak! Focus! How do you get out of here? You need...

You buy... - Holy moly! That's you? What happened? - What happened was... - That's... That came out wrong. I took a teaching job at a place where people don't send their kids to school! Mingling with their sworn enemy's spawn? Oh, no! We can't have that! So, now I'm reduced to doing this so I can get some money and start fresh somewhere far, far away from here.

Home sweet home. Ow! What the... - Mail that, postman! - Now wait a minute, that's completely... Go home, you loser! Oh, yeah? Well, if I'm a loser, then you're a, uh... You're too far. You're gone. Well, lots of nice, natural light, rustic touches, central air and panoramic views. Perfect for animal lovers. - Enjoy. - Wait! Wait! This can't be right! I... Oh, I get it. Did my father put you up to this? Good one. Ha ha. You got me. Okay, well, enough of that. Show me where I'm really staying. I'd like a hot bath and a look at the dinner menu. Here, let me help you out. You're a postman in Smeerensburg, which is on an island cut off from the world, frigid cold, angry, violent neighbors, and this is home now.

It's not a letter if it doesn't have postage, right? - Psst. Hey. Hey, you. - Hmm? You want a toy? Hey! Would you, uh... like a brand-new toy? Just write a letter to Mr. Klaus. And you put it in the envelope, write your name on it and bring a penny. Can't forget the penny. These better sound sad. Do they sound sad? Okay, good job. All right. And now... for the tricky part. All right. Remember... probably not an ax murderer, though... it still is a possibility, but most likely... no. He's a good guy... deep down. Hello. Hello. Mr... Klaus, I take it? You remember me from the nice breaking and entering last night? Jesper Johanssen, postman, but we never properly... Uh... I, uh... You see, Mr. Klaus, it seems like word got around that the poor children of Smeerensburg have started, uh... completely unprompted... writing letters asking you for... toys. So I figured you have the whole barn filled with toys just sitting there collecting dust, so... Oh, God. Okay. This is it. Here it goes. Oh, wow. That is... totally normal. Not a symptom of any mental illness or anything. - Go away. - Mr. Klaus, sir! Those little children... ...if you donate your old toys to them... ...well, I'll gladly deliver them for free! Mr. Klaus, wait! Please! Think of all the joy you'll bring their miserable little lives! Look, here. Poor little Herlief. He only has sticks and stones to play with. So sad. And this one, little Penny... Patty. Her doll was so old, it crumbled in her arms when she came to me. And then Kristoff... Little, ugly Kristoff. This little... Tonight, same time. Great! What, \"same time\"? You mean, dead of night?"

Hey, you put... ...one hand on those toys and I swear I... Stand back. All right. Do what you will with the toys. But no one gets hurt. Suits us just fine.

Why, we were just thinking, \"Don't our children also deserve a present?\" And lookie here! You've already got her favorite thing in the world. A nice, big piñata! Hey, you put... ...one hand on those toys and I swear I... Stand back. All right. Do what you will with the toys. But no one gets hurt. Suits us just fine. How long until children go back to the old ways once there are no toys to bribe them with? How long until they turn against each other? And how long until the grown-ups follow? Jesper? The postman! Ha! Eat our snow, you... They're not attached. Why aren't they attached? I thought they were attached. I would never, in a million years, have done what I just did if I didn't think these were attached. After them! Who leaves a sleigh unattached like... Aah! Destroy those toys! - Stop them at any cost! - Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine... Mine! I could really use a hand here. \"Use.\" Interesting choice of word. Really? You're gonna go for the guilt trip now? Smash those toys to pieces! The toys! - We have to close that bag! - What do you care? - I thought you were leaving. - Great. Sure. I'll tell you what.
