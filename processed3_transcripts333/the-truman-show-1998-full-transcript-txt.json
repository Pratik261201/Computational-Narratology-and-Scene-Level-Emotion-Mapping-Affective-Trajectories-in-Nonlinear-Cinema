While the world he inhabits is, in some respects, counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards. It isn't always Shakespeare, but it's genuine. It's a life. I'm not going to make it. You're going to have to go on without me. No way, mister. You're going to the top of this mountain, broken legs and all. We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort. You're crazy, you know that? For me, there is no difference between a private life and a public life. My life, is my life, is The Truman Show. The Truman Show is a lifestyle. It's a noble life. It is a truly blessed life. Yeah, tell me something I don't know. All right. Promise me one thing, though. If I die before I reach the summit, you'll use me as an alternative source of food Gross. It's all true. It's all real. Nothing here is fake. Nothing you see on this show is fake. It's merely controlled. Eat me, damn it. That's an order. Maybe just your love handles. I have love handles? Yeah. Little ones. Truman. You're going to be late. Okay! - Good morning. - Morning. Good morning. In case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night. Yeah. - Morning, Truman. - Morning, Spencer. Hey, Pluto. No, get down. - He won't hurt you. - Get down. I know. - It's just me. - Come on, Pluto. What is it? Here's a news flash just in. An aircraft in trouble began shedding parts as it flew over Seahaven just a few moments ago. Luckily, no one was hurt. But, hey, how do you feel today? That's good. You thinking of flying somewhere? - Nope. - No? Good This is Classical Clive with Classical Drive so why don't you forget about the perils of flying, settle back, and let this music calm you down? - Dog Fancy, please. - Dog Fancy. - Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. Give me a paper there, will you, Earl? And one of these for the wife. Loves her fashion mags. Will that be all for you, Truman? - That's the whole kit and caboodle. - Catch you later. Okay. Yeah. Good morning. - Hank. - Morning, Truman. - Good morning, Truman. - How are you guys? - Beautiful day, isn't it? - Always. And how's your lovely wife? Good. How about yours? - Couldn't be better.",

Hey, fellows. You going in? Go ahead. - Go ahead. - No, you first, please. I'm not that anxious to get there. Yes, hello. Could I have directory assistance for Fiji, please? Fiji islands. Truman, did you see this? I'm sorry, ma'am. If he's in a coma, he's probably uninsurable. Hello? Yes. Fiji, please. Do you have a listing for Lauren Garland? Nothing listed? Okay. Do you have a Sylvia Garland? \"S\" for Sylvia. Nothing? Okay. Thank you. - Lawrence. - Hey, Burbank. Got a prospect in Wells Park I need you to close. Wells Park? - On Harbor Island? - You know another one? I can't do it. I have an appointment. Dentist. You're going to lose a lot more than your teeth if you don't meet your quota. Look, Truman, they're making cutbacks at the end of this month. - Cutbacks? - Yeah. Now, you need this. Besides, a half-hour across the bay, a little sea air would do you good. Thanks. Hello. Ferry's still here. Thought I might have missed it. One-way or return? Return. There you go, sir. - Do you need any help, sir? - You go ahead. I'll be fine. Yeah. Hi, honey. Look what I got free at the checkout. It's a Chef's Pal. It's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in one. Never needs sharpening, dishwasher-safe. Wow! That's amazing. Truman, you missed a spot. That is a beer. You know, I'm thinking about getting out, Marlon. Yeah? Out of what? Out of my job, out of Seahaven. - Off this island. Out. - Out of yourjob? What the hell's wrong with yourjob? You have a great job, Truman. You have a desk job. I'd kill for a desk job. Here you go. You should try stocking vending machines for a living. - No, thanks. - Now there's excitement. Don't you ever get antsy? Itchy feet? Where's there to go? Fiji. Where the hell's Fiji? Near Florida? - See here? - Yeah. This is us, and all the way around here, Fiji. You can't get any further away before you start coming back. You know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human being has ever set foot. So when are you going to go? It's not that simple. It takes money, planning. I can't just up and go. Right. I'm going to do it. Don't worry about that. Bonus time is just around the corner.",

Every time you and Marlon get together... We can bum around the world for a year on that. And then what, Truman? We'd be where we were five years ago. - You're talking like a teenager. - Maybe I feel like a teenager. We have mortgage payments, Truman. We have car payments. What, we're just going to walk away from our financial obligations? It would be an adventure. I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure? That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world, explore. Honey, you want to be an explorer? This'll pass. We all think like this now and then. Let's get you out of these wet clothes, come to bed. You never see anything anyway. They always turn the camera and play music and, you know, the wind blows in, and the curtains move and you don't see anything. - Dog Fancy, please. - Dog Fancy. Thank you. - Paper, Earl, please. - Paper. I might as well pick one of these up while I'm at it. - For the wife? - She's got to have them. - Anything else, Truman? - That's the whole ball of wax. - Catch you later. - Okay. Dad? What are you doing? What the... Get out of the way! Stop them! Stop those people! Open the doors! Somebody, stop the bus! Stop the bus! Somebody, stop it! Somebody, stop the bus! And wasn't it funny... It doesn't sound insane at all, Truman. I see him 10 times a week in 100 different faces. I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday. It was Dad. I swear. Dressed like a homeless man. And you know what else was strange? A businessman and a woman with a little dog came out of nowhere and forced him onto a bus. It's about time they cleaned up the trash downtown before we become just like the rest of the country. They never found Dad's body. Maybe somehow... God! I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin. - Did Dad have a brother? - Truman, you know perfectly well that your father was an only child, just like you.

You know, you really ought to throw out that mower. Get one of those new Elk Rotaries. What's he doing? See, they got rid of her, but they couldn't erase the memory. The memory of who? - You okay? You all right? - Excuse me. Hi. - Hi. - I'm so sorry I fell on you like that. - It's okay. - I've just been such a klutz all day. It's all right. Sprained this ankle. Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry. - I'm so sorry to fall on you like that. - That's all right. Don't worry about it. - I'm Meryl. - Hi, I'm Truman. Hey, nice to meet you. - Truman, you've studied enough. - No. I got to commit this to memory. Come on, Truman, one ice-cold brewski. Come on. You're going to have to copy off me, so be careful.

I'm Truman Burbank. Yeah, I know. You know, Truman, I'm not allowed to talk to you. Really? Yeah. I can understand that. I'm a pretty dangerous character. I'm sorry. It's not up to me. A girl's got to be careful. - You have a boyfriend, right? - No, it's not that. Was it Meryl, that girl that was with me? We're not... We don't... We're just friends. - It's nothing like that. - It's how I look? Not your type? No. I like your pin. I was wondering that myself. Would you want to maybe, possibly, sometime go out for some pizza or something? Like, Friday? - Saturday? - I can't. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? - We have finals tomorrow. - Yeah, I know. If we don't go now, it won't happen. Do you understand? So what do you want to do? Please keep your hands inside the car! This is my favorite pizza place. Tony! One large, extra plankton. We have so little time. They're going to be here any minute. - Who are? - They don't want me talking to you. Then don't talk. They're here. - Truman. - What do they want? Listen to me.

        "You, sailing off into that storm. But I've never blamed you, Truman, and I don't blame you now. Truman? What are you doing down here? Fixing the mower. - Saw my father today. - I know. Your mother called. You really shouldn't upset her like that. Did you want... What did you want? I made macaroni. I'm not hungry. You know, you really ought to throw out that mower. Get one of those new Elk Rotaries. What's he doing? See, they got rid of her, but they couldn't erase the memory. The memory of who? - You okay? You all right? - Excuse me. Hi. - Hi. - I'm so sorry I fell on you like that. - It's okay. - I've just been such a klutz all day. It's all right. Sprained this ankle. Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry. - I'm so sorry to fall on you like that. - That's all right. Don't worry about it. - I'm Meryl. - Hi, I'm Truman. Hey, nice to meet you. - Truman, you've studied enough. - No. I got to commit this to memory. Come on, Truman, one ice-cold brewski. Come on. You're going to have to copy off me, so be careful. You're a better person than I am. - See you later. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. See you later, loser. Hi. - Konnichi-wa - What? You take Japanese. Yes. Lauren, right? It's on the... Lauren. Right. I'm Truman Burbank. Yeah, I know. You know, Truman, I'm not allowed to talk to you. Really? Yeah. I can understand that. I'm a pretty dangerous character. I'm sorry. It's not up to me. A girl's got to be careful. - You have a boyfriend, right? - No, it's not that. Was it Meryl, that girl that was with me? We're not... We don't... We're just friends. - It's nothing like that. - It's how I look? Not your type? No. I like your pin. I was wondering that myself. Would you want to maybe, possibly, sometime go out for some pizza or something? Like, Friday? - Saturday? - I can't. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? - We have finals tomorrow. - Yeah, I know. If we don't go now, it won't happen. Do you understand? So what do you want to do? Please keep your hands inside the car! This is my favorite pizza place. Tony! One large, extra plankton. We have so little time. They're going to be here any minute. - Who are? - They don't want me talking to you. Then don't talk. They're here. - Truman. - What do they want? Listen to me. Everybody knows about you. Everybody knows everything you do. They're pretending, Truman."

But before we get into that, I think it's worth noting this is not the first time someone from the outside has attempted to reach Truman, is it? We have had our close calls in the past. Truman! It's television! Yes! Yes! I did it! I'm on The Truman Show! But there's never been anything to compare with this most recent breach in security. The first intruder to be a former cast member A dead one at that. Got to say, writing Kirk back in, masterstroke. Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it. Truman! Truman, no! That's off-limits. - Why? What's over there? - Nothing. It's dangerous. That's all. You've got to know your limitations, Truman. But let's remind viewers of exactly why Dad was written out in the first place. As Truman grew up, we were forced to manufacture ways to keep him on the island. I'd like to be an explorer, like the great Magellan. You're too late. There's really nothing left to explore. Finally, I came up with the concept of Kirk's drowning. Most effective. Truman's been terrified of the water ever since When Kirk read the synopsis for the Death At Sea episode, he was disappointed, to say the least. I'm sure that's what caused him to break back onto the set. But how do you intend to explain his 22-year absence? - Amnesia. - Brilliant. Let's take some viewer phone calls. Charlotte, North Carolina, you're on with Christof. Yeah, hi, Christof. I was just wondering how many cameras you got there in that town. Somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000. - That's a lot of cameras. - Remember, we started with just one. He was curious from birth Premature by two weeks. It was almost as if he couldn't wait to get started. And his eagerness to leave his mother's womb was the very reason he was the one who was selected. In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies, the casting of a show, determined by an air date, Truman was the one who arrived on cue. Incidentally, I believe Truman is the first child to have been legally adopted by a corporation.",

It has been a singular honor and a pleasure, sir. - Christof, thank you. - Thank you, Mike. - Simeon. - What? Is he looking at us? Jesus, do you think he knows? Hello? Better call Christof. Hello? Come in, Major Burbank. Jesus. - He's back to his old self. - Thank God. That's an unusual cat, my man. I hereby proclaim this planet... Trumania of the Burbank galaxy. - Is he gonna go? - Okay, hallway camera ready. That one's for free Keep up with him, 'cause he'll move fast. Stand by, all house cameras. - Morning! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. In case I don't see you... Good afternoon, good evening, and good night. - Good afternoon... - Good morning. ...evening and good night. - Morning, Truman. - Morning, Spencer. - How's it going? - Let me check. Vital signs are good. Pluto! Good morning, Truman. - Look who's here. - Beautiful day, isn't it? Every single day. The policy, we've thought about it and we're gonna take it. - You're kidding? - No! Why don't we go up to my office right now and we'll sign the papers? Next week would be much better. - All right. See you guys. - Okay, bye now. See you next week. - Give me something to look forward to. - You got it. See, this isn't about insurance. This is about the great variable: when will death occur? Could be a week, a month, a year. Could be today. \"Sunbather, minding his own business, \"stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella. \" No way to guard against that kind of thing. Sorry, excuse me. Truman, this is Vivien. Vivien, this is Truman. The two of you are gonna be neighbors. I guess what I'm saying is that life is fragile. - Vivien, your office. - Sorry. What's that? I'm sorry. You do? Great. Let me take your information."
