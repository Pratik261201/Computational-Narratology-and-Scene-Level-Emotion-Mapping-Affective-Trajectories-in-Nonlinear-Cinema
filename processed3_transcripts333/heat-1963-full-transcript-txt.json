You've left your rattle-toy at home? He's not an arrist. Dzuraev is a famous tractor driver. He set some kind of record. It's him alright. It's only they haven't thought of putting his picture in the local paper. No, I mean it. I read about him somewhere. I really did. Maybe in 'Crocodile', satyrical paper Well, yes, of course, in the paper! Dzuraev was the first in Kyrgyzstan to plough at high speed. On pre-war tractors, really? ??? Big numbers, little substance. - Where is he now? - Who knows. Maybe, he's gone to the city. To work at the factory. I don't know. Exactly. I once also knew a combine operator. She received a certificate of merit and moved to the city. And now she's a manager in a restaurant. Aldey, more tea! I see then. You want to become a manager. Thank you. A photovoltaic cell. What? A solar cell. On sattelites they transform sunrays into electricity. - They look like this drinking bowl. - Savant! Let's go, Kalipa. Go with them, Kemel. You'll work for Abakir. I need him like a hole in the head. Sadabek, take him instead of me. And I'll leave. I won't let you go before the tillage is over. Have him drive a water carrier. Well, you'll have to drive a water carrier. - What do you mean a water carrier? - Don't be stubborn. And you, put this on. But I've been sent here to work on a trailer. There's no other work in the unit. Leave if you like. Abakir! That tractor driver Kemel was talking about... could he be your relative?",

They forgot to install the electricity in Anrakhai. But it's battery-powered. All you need to do is check the contacts. So it might even work one day? Yeah, Abakir, you messed up Abakir, give me your singlets! To Dzuraev, the best tractor driver. Abakir... You wanted the rags. Hey you! Leave the rags! Stop weeping! Get to work! And don't meddle in other people's business next time! Know your place, squaw! You offended Kalipa. Very much! Listen, why are you blinking? I mean it! Well, since you mean it, then we'll talk. Follow me! What have you come here for? What? Why are you here? Because of money or because it's your call? - You already know it. - Say it again. I'm here to work. To work then? Do you know what is down there? Baikonur. The road to the space. They launch rockets there. Why don't you go there to work! One doesn't work in Anrakhai. In Anrakhai one slaves away and doesn't stick one's nose into other people's business. Got it? No. We're people, not cattle. If we slave away, as you say, then we do it for a purpose. For what purpose? To make life on earth better. What fine words! \"People and not cattle.\" You really believe in this crap? Here's my advice. Trust only your own hands and eyes. Take a look around. Look at this dead land. Do you know why we're ploughing this dust? To prove to our posterity that in this place cannot grow even lucerne. You just don't understand. Tractor's idle again. I'm really sorry. I'm a bit late. Late? You were with a missy! - Abakir! - What? Why are you like this? Why can't you treat people properly? That was good. Everyone respects you for your work.

        "The radio! It's top notch! What a wonderful radio that is! It's simply suberb! Here! Have a look! It's smooth! It's brand new! It's polished! The only thing is - it doesn't work. They forgot to install the electricity in Anrakhai. But it's battery-powered. All you need to do is check the contacts. So it might even work one day? Yeah, Abakir, you messed up Abakir, give me your singlets! To Dzuraev, the best tractor driver. Abakir... You wanted the rags. Hey you! Leave the rags! Stop weeping! Get to work! And don't meddle in other people's business next time! Know your place, squaw! You offended Kalipa. Very much! Listen, why are you blinking? I mean it! Well, since you mean it, then we'll talk. Follow me! What have you come here for? What? Why are you here? Because of money or because it's your call? - You already know it. - Say it again. I'm here to work. To work then? Do you know what is down there? Baikonur. The road to the space. They launch rockets there. Why don't you go there to work! One doesn't work in Anrakhai. In Anrakhai one slaves away and doesn't stick one's nose into other people's business. Got it? No. We're people, not cattle. If we slave away, as you say, then we do it for a purpose. For what purpose? To make life on earth better. What fine words! \"People and not cattle.\" You really believe in this crap? Here's my advice. Trust only your own hands and eyes. Take a look around. Look at this dead land. Do you know why we're ploughing this dust? To prove to our posterity that in this place cannot grow even lucerne. You just don't understand. Tractor's idle again.

A fierce and dreadful Roach! \"Don't you dare to approach!\" He roars, he rages. \"I'll lock you in cages And swallow you all Like one tiny meatball!\" Look! Abakir has gone mad. What is it, Abakir? Tired? What did you say? Fool. There was a turtle. I thought you were tired. Can I ask you a little question, comrade Dzuraev? Your records, have you set them with the same shortcomings? With such thorns, no one would do better. There used to be a special unit to burn weeds for me. - And then I came at high speed. - Why aren't they here now? No one cares about it. Kalipa. It's late. And the food got cold. And where is Kemel? I'm not his babysitter. Why are you like this, Abakir? You've become like a devil yourself, and you want to drive the kid to the grave. One couldn't drive someone like him to the grave. You're here. Listen, Abakir, what was that race you organized? Am I fulfilling the plan? Of course. It's almost a record. Then congratulate me and bug off. Why are you harass the boy? No matter how I bend over backwards, I never get a kind word from you. Are you tired? I've grown old. Abakir, look - there's a glow! The milksop's burning the weeds."
