(CLOCK TICKING) (TICKING) (CLOCKS CHIMING) (TV PLAYING) REPORTER: ...Continue to protest the presence of a convicted sex offender in their midst. Michelle betler reports. Thanks, Rick. I'm standing here on woodward court, the quiet residential street that has become the focus of controversy ever since 48-year-old Ronald James mcgorvey returned here after serving a two-year prison sentence for indecent exposure to a minor. In the past few days an organization known as the Committee of Concerned Parents began distributing these notices throughout the community warning neighbors of what they call a quote, \"dangerous predator in our midst.\" I don't really like having him that close to my family. I think it's outrageous. This block has too many children for a sex offender to, uh, be moving in the neighborhood. I... I don't think it's a good idea. Makes me very nervous. Makes me a little enraged. Um, I'd have a problem if I see him on the street. It's like having an alcoholic work in a bar. They don't mix. They shouldn't be together. MICHELLE: The conditions of his parole expressly forbid mcgorvey to be within 100 yards of any playground, school or recreation area where children normally gather. These conditions seem to be of little comfort to the many parents whose children play and go to school in this formerly tranquil community, and who in the coming days and weeks will be hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. Rick, back to you. (CHILDREN CHATTERING) My husband and I had an actual spiritual experience. We did this intense spa treatment... - WOMAN: Oh, come on. - No, listen to me. It was on our vacation in cabo and there were eight other couples and this Mayan woman. A goddess, just a goddess. - She had... - She's due in September. She thinks she's gonna take three months off, then it's Christmas, then she'll be back to work the first of the year. Please. Six months from now she'll be right here on this bench with us. My friend Beth said that the way she did it was to just take him with her every time she went to the bathroom. - I find that strange. - Yeah, that's what I said to Beth. It's oedipal. What's the rush? Although I will say, when I was trying to potty-train Christian, I opened the diaper and it was huge!",

Paul and I were having sex the other night and I drifted off right in the middle of it. (CHUCKLES) It happens. Yeah, I guess. But when I woke up and apologized he said he hadn't even noticed. You know what you should do? Set aside a specific block of time for it. That's what Louis and I do... Every Tuesday night at 9:00. NARRATOR: \"whether you want to or not\" Sarah thought, her eyes straying over to the play area. Even at such a tiny playground as this, Lucy didn't interact much with the other children. Sarah didn't really know why they even bothered coming here, except that she'd probably go crazy trapped in the house all day with this unknowable little person.

Ready? Mommy... Where's my snack? I'm sorry, honey, mommy can't find it. - I forgot the rice cakes. - Poor thing. - SARAH: I'm sure it's in here somewhere. - Second time this week. Well, who's going to keep track of everything? - LUCY: Bad mommy. Bad mommy. - SARAH: Just calm down, please. No calm down! I want my snack! All right, you know what? It's... It's just not here, okay? See for yourself. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) MARY ANN: Wait! Troy, honey, give Lucy your goldfish. No! Troy Jonathan, give me those goldfish! But, mama, they're mine. No back talk. You can share with your sister. Troy has goldfish for you. Go sit down. That's much more than 10. - That's great. - Look how big I made my lawn. Thank you, Mary Ann, you're a lifesaver. It's nothing. I just hate to see her suffer like that. Maybe you should make a checklist and tape it to the door so it's the last thing you see before leaving the house.",

We've never actually spoken to him. Really? - We don't even know his name. - (CHUCKLES) I thought you guys said he was a regular here. - It was awkward. - He made us nervous. You had to think about what you were gonna wear in the morning. You know, put on makeup. It was exhausting. (CHILDREN CHATTERING) Mommy, push me! Okay. I'll be right there. Wait! Five bucks if you get his phone number. (CHUCKLES) (SWING SQUEAKING) How old is she? Lucy, tell the nice boy how old you are. I'm three. My grandma lives in New Jersey. She doesn't have a swim pool.

After all this time, two days in a row. Where's the fire? Maybe he needed a vacation. From what? From being the prom king. It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it. -  -  - Close it? - Close it.  close the gate. There you go. - AARON: It's open. - BRAD: It's all right. - Somebody else will close it. - Are we practicing? AARON: Are we playing up on the swings? BRAD: Swing time! What's he do for a living? We've never actually spoken to him. Really? - We don't even know his name. -  I thought you guys said he was a regular here. - It was awkward. - He made us nervous. You had to think about what you were gonna wear in the morning. You know, put on makeup. It was exhausting.  Mommy, push me! Okay. I'll be right there. Wait! Five bucks if you get his phone number.   How old is she? Lucy, tell the nice boy how old you are. I'm three. My grandma lives in New Jersey. She doesn't have a swim pool. Do you like to swim? I don't like sharks."

We're doing \"madame bovary.\" -  - You could be my little sister. Little sister? We're trying to get younger women involved. We call them our little sisters.  I don't know, Jean. I read \"madame bovary\" in grad school. It's a pretty misogynist text. Well, that's an interesting perspective. - You should come. - Let me think about it. Oh, would you excuse me, Jean? Someone's at my door. I'll call you, okay? Hi!  Hi! Wow, god, this is a surprise. I haven't seen you since... I... I hope you don't mind. Your husband said you'd be back any minute. Oh, no, not at all. It's good to see you. God, um, can I get you some tea or something? I can only stay a minute. I just came to warn you. You know that guy, the pervert? - Uh-huh. - He's been riding his bike near the playground - checking out the kids. - Oh, god. Oh, god, do the police know? Nothing they can do. He's not breaking any laws. I guess they're just waiting for him to kill someone. I just thought you should know. Thanks, that's nice of you. Let me get you some tea. I'm sorry. I... I don't think it's a good idea. I didn't mean to kiss him. I don't even know how it happened. I'd better go. Mike's gonna worry. RICHARD: You wanna talk? I'm tired.  -  -     Hello. Hey. No, he's still sleeping. Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm going through it right now. No, I guess I don't need them. Okay. All right, bye. -  -  H-hi.  H-hello? Yes, I'd like to place an order.

There are four whole columns of lonely women here, and only a handful of men. The odds are on our side. Why wouldn't one of these women want to meet a nice person like you? I'm not a nice person. You did a bad thing. But that doesn't mean you're a bad person. I have a psychosexual disorder. You're better now. They wouldn't have let you out if you weren't. They let me out because they had to. Well, maybe if you found a girlfriend closer to your own age you wouldn't have the bad urges so often. I don't want a girlfriend my own age, mommy. I wish I did. What are you going to do when I'm gone? Who's going to take care of you? What's the matter, mommy? Are you sick or something? I'm an old woman. I'm not going to live forever. Who's going to cook for you? Who's going to wash the dishes? I can wash the dishes. You've never washed a dish in your life. I could do it if I had to. I'm not a retard. No, you're not. You're a miracle, Ronnie. We're all miracles. You know why? Because as humans, everyday we go about our business, and all that time we know, we all know that the things we love, the people we love..."

Did anybody like this book? Because I really just hated it. It's so depressing. She cheats on her husband with two different guys, wastes all his money, then kills herself with rat poison? Do I really need to read this? Well, there is a lot of good descriptive writing. It's supposed to be depressing. It's a tragedy. Madame bovary was undone by a tragic flaw. What's her flaw? Blindness. She didn't see that the men were just using her. She just wants a little romance in her life. - You can't blame her for that. - It's about women's choices.

I was a little puzzled by some of the sexual references. Look, like... like this one. Um... \"He abandoned every last shred\" of restraint and consideration. He turned her into something compliant, \"something corrupt.\" Does anyone know what that means? It means she's a slut. Is he tying her up or something? Anal sex. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Did everyone get that but me? Let's set that aside for now. I'm really eager to hear what our other little sister has to say. I'm not sure if you know this, but Sarah has a phd in english lit. Just a masters. I never wrote my dissertation. Well, you still have a lot more expertise than the rest of us. I think I understand your feelings about this book. I used to have some problems with it myself. When I read it in grad school, madame bovary just seemed like a fool. She marries the wrong man, makes one foolish mistake after another.",

For the first time in my life I feel like anything is possible. Like I can do anything, you know?  What are we doing? What do you mean? It's not real, Brad. What? This. It's wrong and it's weird. How long are we gonna sneak around together? How long can that last? I can't do this anymore. No, no don't say that. As long as I know that we're gonna have this... Have what? What is this?  look...
