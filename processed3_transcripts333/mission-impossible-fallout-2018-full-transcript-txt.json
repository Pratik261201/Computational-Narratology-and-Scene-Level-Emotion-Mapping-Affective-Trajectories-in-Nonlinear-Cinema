To live a double life, to fail to prevent her abduction, erase her identity, force her into hiding, take away all she has known... Stop. ...in a selfish, futile, fleeting attempt... Stop. ...to escape your own true self? Please, stop. And, Julia, do you choose to accept? Don't. - I do. - No. You should have killed me, Ethan. Fate whispers to the warrior... A storm is coming. And the warrior whispers back... I am the storm. Good evening, Mr. Hunt. The anarchist Solomon Lane. Since you captured him 2 years ago, his absence from the world stage has had unintended consequences. His Syndicate of rogue covert operatives continues to wreak havoc around the globe. The CIA's Special Activities Division has relentlessly hunted Lane's elite network of hostiles. But many remain unknown and at large. The remnants of this extremist splinter cell refer to themselves as \"The Apostles.\" They have since adopted a policy of terror-for-hire, making them an even greater threat. They are responsible for the recent smallpox outbreak in Indian-controlled Kashmir, along the borders of China and Pakistan, threatening one-third of the world's population. The epidemic is being contained, but intelligence would indicate that a new client has hired the Apostles for a more ambitious operation. They have been contacted by this man, an unidentified extremist known only by the code name John Lark, author of this apocalyptic manifesto calling for the destruction of the current world order. It is believed Lark is responsible for the disappearance of Norwegian nuclear weapons specialist Nils Delbruuk. Dr. Delbruuk's security clearance was revoked after he expressed fiercely anti-religious views. Meanwhile, the Apostles have been in contact with elements of the Eastern European underworld, who are in possession of three plutonium cores stolen from a missile base in eastern Russia. This would indicate that John Lark and the Apostles are working together to acquire functioning nuclear weapons. NEST estimates that a man with Delbruuk's knowledge, using the materials in play, could complete three nuclear weapons in as little as 72 hours.",

The attacks occurred at precisely the same moment, just over an hour ago, at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Within minutes of the attack... ...Congress ordered an emergency recess and the Capitol Building was evacuated. The President left Washington on Air Force One.

Did we get it? Of course we got it. I told you we'd get it. I don't understand. The attacks didn't happen? The car accident you were in, that was an hour ago. I was driving the other car. What's done is done, when we say it's done. Sir. That phone you unlocked led us to a server in Iceland where we managed to decrypt a communique between John Lark and this woman: Alana Mitsopolis, activist and philanthropist, whose charity work has earned her the nickname the White Widow."

Lark and the Widow are meeting tonight to negotiate delivery of an unspecified package, which we can only assume is our missing plutonium. They'll make contact in a private lounge at the Grand Palais in Paris during her annual fundraising event. The details are in the file. If Lark isn't there by midnight, the Widow will leave and sell the package to the highest bidder. Which gives you two hours from now to find Lark. Sir, I think there's something you need to know. I'm gonna stop you right there. You had a terrible choice to make in Berlin: Recover the plutonium or save your team. You chose your team, and now the world is at risk. Some flaw deep in your core being simply won't allow you to choose between one life and millions. You see that as a sign of weakness. To me, that's your greatest strength. It also tells me I can count on you to cover my ass. Because coming over here from the CIA was a lateral move, some say a step down. But I did it because of you. Don't make me regret it. Make the call. Shut 'em down. What do you think you're doing, Erika? It may be your mission, but this is the CIA's plane. It doesn't take off without my say-so. We don't have time for this. I have a team in Paris ready to grab Lark as soon as he leaves the Palais. A G5 standing by to rendition him to Gitmo, where a waterboard is waiting. Spend 24 hours we don't have to pull a confession we can't trust from a man we haven't positively identified? No. We need reliable intelligence, and we need it now. This scenario is precisely why the IMF exists! The IMF is Halloween, Alan. A bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick-or-treat. And if he had held on to the plutonium in Berlin, we wouldn't be having this conversation. And his team would be dead. Yes. They would. That's the job. And that's why I want one of my own men on the scene to appraise the situation. Agent Walker, Special Activities. His reputation precedes. You use a scalpel. I prefer a hammer. The answer is no. I have operational authority here, direct from the President. You have a problem with that, you take it up with him. I have already, and he agrees with me.",

Max had no illusions about the world we live in today. But she had dreams of a very different future. One in which her unique talents were no longer required. All she earned from the way the world is went ultimately to making it what it could someday be. That future isn't here yet. Tonight, your contributions have brought it just a little closer. Thank you all for coming. Enjoy the party. You can't possibly be John Lark. I'm not, actually. It's an alias. I suppose it's better than John Doe. Is there another name you prefer? Is there somewhere we could talk privately? In fact I like \"Lark.\" It does have a certain ring. We don't have a lot of time. 'Cause I'll be honest. A man of your reputation, I was expecting someone uglier. Don't let looks deceive. I'm as ugly as they come. And I'll be honest with you. Your life is in danger. Don't you touch her. Relax. It's my brother. You're being rude to our guest, Zola. It's time to go. Don't turn this into a scene. You don't want to be with this one. - You were saying? - Your life is in danger. And who would want to kill me? The Americans, for starters. If that were true, I would know it. You think you're the only one with spies in the government? There are people here who don't want this meeting to happen. Don't believe me? Look around. I know what you're thinking. Maybe they're not here for you. Maybe they're just here for me. Are you willing to take that chance? You have something I want. Right now, that makes me the only person you can trust to get you out of here alive. Or would you rather leave that to your brother? I think I'd like to go home now, Mr. Lark. The French government took receipt of the asset at noon today. Delivery will be via air to the Finance Ministry at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. An armored motorcade under heavy police escort will transport him via this route. We'll create a diversion at this intersection, here. The motorcade will automatically take the preplanned alternate route here, where we'll extract the asset. Extract the asset? The asset. We paid a great deal of money for this information.",

I don't care in the least what people think or feel. In my experience, they don't do either for very long. Oh, and I suppose that justifies bombing factories or bringing down civilian aircraft. Or strapping me into an explosive vest! Consider it unfinished business, my funny little friend. - Luther? - Almost there. You see the end as clearly as I do, Ethan. Governments the world over are descending into madness. The Syndicate was created to tear them down, brick by brick. The Syndicate was a pack of murdering cowards. The Syndicate was civilization's last hope! A chance to smash the old world order. That hope is gone now because of you and your pathetic morality. You should have killed me, Ethan. The end you've always feared is coming. It's coming! And the blood will be on your hands. The fallout of all your good intentions. - Time. - Got it. Get him up. You're mine now. You're just full of surprises, Lark. Your brother's plan was bad from the word go. You'd have lost all your men and Lane would've been killed in the crossfire. I had to improvise. Well, why not say that in the first place? Because I don't trust your people. Especially not your brother. Family. What can you do? So, where's Lane? Certainly not at the bottom of the Seine. I have him. He's safe. Where do I meet the courier? Let's talk about the woman. Woman? She was with you at the Palais. Zola saw her again today. She tried to kill Lane. She had the chance to kill you, but she didn't. Why? We have a past. It's complicated. Well, I'll make it more complicated for you. My price just went up. Someone killed four of my men today. I'm assuming it was her. I want her, Lark. And you're gonna bring her to me. Otherwise, you don't meet the courier and the plutonium goes to the highest bidder. I'd hate for her to come between us. She's yours. At the meeting. Not before. Go to London. Instructions will follow. I knew if I followed her, you'd show up eventually. Are you okay? Ilsa, I never wanted to hurt you. I know you have your reasons. I know. You need to walk away. I can't do that. You weren't at the Palais to kill Lark. No.",

        "Strange accusation coming from a terrorist. Sixty seconds. Terrorists are schoolboys desperate for attention, hoping to shape public opinion through fear. I don't care in the least what people think or feel. In my experience, they don't do either for very long. Oh, and I suppose that justifies bombing factories or bringing down civilian aircraft. Or strapping me into an explosive vest! Consider it unfinished business, my funny little friend. - Luther? - Almost there. You see the end as clearly as I do, Ethan. Governments the world over are descending into madness. The Syndicate was created to tear them down, brick by brick. The Syndicate was a pack of murdering cowards. The Syndicate was civilization's last hope! A chance to smash the old world order. That hope is gone now because of you and your pathetic morality. You should have killed me, Ethan. The end you've always feared is coming. It's coming! And the blood will be on your hands. The fallout of all your good intentions. - Time. - Got it. Get him up. You're mine now. You're just full of surprises, Lark. Your brother's plan was bad from the word go. You'd have lost all your men and Lane would've been killed in the crossfire. I had to improvise. Well, why not say that in the first place? Because I don't trust your people. Especially not your brother. Family. What can you do? So, where's Lane? Certainly not at the bottom of the Seine. I have him. He's safe. Where do I meet the courier? Let's talk about the woman. Woman? She was with you at the Palais. Zola saw her again today. She tried to kill Lane. She had the chance to kill you, but she didn't. Why? We have a past. It's complicated. Well, I'll make it more complicated for you. My price just went up. Someone killed four of my men today. I'm assuming it was her. I want her, Lark. And you're gonna bring her to me. Otherwise, you don't meet the courier and the plutonium goes to the highest bidder. I'd hate for her to come between us. She's yours. At the meeting. Not before. Go to London. Instructions will follow. I knew if I followed her, you'd show up eventually. Are you okay? Ilsa, I never wanted to hurt you. I know you have your reasons. I know. You need to walk away. I can't do that. You weren't at the Palais to kill Lark. No."

And I don't trust a living soul in that room to get it. We'll sort out who's who in Washington. - Erika! - Sir? It's all right. Let's just do what she says. The only real threats are in this room, and we have them. Do you? Go. Where the hell is Lane? Ethan! Ethan! First team is down. Send backup. Sir! Oh, no, no, no. Man down! Man down! Somebody help! Sir. Ethan, I tagged Walker, but he's on the run. You got to get him. Go. I'm sorry, sir. Go. Ethan? Wait! Get that son of a bitch. Come on, come on, come on. Yes! I got him. I'm sorry. Talk to me, Benji. Where's Walker? He's about a quarter mile west if you turn right. To my right? I can't do that. Why not? Because I'm being followed. What do you mean? By who? How do I know?

The remote detonator requires that firing key. If we remove that key, then it should short out the fail-safe and allow us to cut both fuses. So one of us needs to get the detonator and remove that key. Yeah. While the rest of us cut the fuses on both bombs. Simple. Yeah, but... But what? Well, in order to make this work, we can't remove the key or cut the fuses until after the countdown starts. But wait, just so I've got this clear. Our only chance to safely defuse both bombs is to let the countdown start. And then remove that key. Okay. Both devices are now connected to the detonator. Fifteen minutes should give you enough time to reach minimum safe distance. My running days are over. This is where it ends for me. I'm getting signals all over the place. We're at a medical camp. X-ray machines, CAT scanners, radiological signatures everywhere. It's like a needle in a haystack. Process of elimination, one at a time. Let's split up. Stay on comms. Ethan? Julia? Is that... Julia! Does he know? Hey. Uh, this is my husband, Erik. Uh, this is... Rob. Rob Thorne. Dr. Rob Thorne. - I worked with Julia... - At Mass General. Before New York. Oh, you're kidding. - What a coincidence! - I know. I... - What brings you all this way? - I was, uh... I was in Turtuk, not far from here and heard help was needed. Oh, well, actually we're just about finished here. The whole village is inoculated. But, um... What were you doing out in Turtuk? Rob's on vacation. No. No, I'm... I'm working. You're a long way from home. Yeah, yeah. Thanks to our guardian angel. Guardian? Well, yeah. We were running a field hospital outside of Darfur when the outbreak happened here. And here comes this phone call from an anonymous donor, out of the blue. And he says he's ready to underwrite the entire operation. One condition. We run the whole thing. Can you believe that?",

        "Do you understand? There's nothing he can do. When the clock runs out, Ethan Hunt will lose everything and everyone he ever cared about. Ilsa! Benji! Benji! Ilsa, where are you? You don't want to see this. Benji! - Ilsa! - Benji! Benji! Benji, stop! Benji! Oh, no, no, no! Stay with me. Stay with me. No, no. Not when I'm this close. Not when I'm this close. Come on, come on! Thank you. Tie him up. Why won't you just die? There's nothing else you can do. Go be with your husband. Luther... Go. Benji, where are you? Okay, Luther, we're inside. Tell us what to do. You should see the red wire attached to the motherboard. Yeah. You need to cut that and the green wire next to it simultaneously. - Okay, ready? - Mmm-hmm. - Set? - Mmm-hmm. Cut. I told you. It can't be stopped. There's nothing you can do. Benji, listen. Turn the screw counterclockwise. Yep. Remove that panel and you'll see the power and ground wires for the fuse. Got it. When the time comes, cut the green wire. Do not cut it yet. Okay. We copy. Ethan, if you can hear me, we're ready to make the cut. Ethan, come in. Benji, how do we know if he's got the key? He'll get it. - Yeah, but how do we know? - He'll get it done! We're out of time. We just have to hope he has it. - Okay, we're ready. - At two seconds we cut. Wait, wait, wait! Why two? Why not one? You want to cut it that close? It's a second we'll never get back. Can we make a decision on this? All right, all right! We'll do it on one. Cutting on one? Yes, one. All right, stand by. Three... - Two... - One. Now! Okay. My man. Ethan? Ethan? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? No. Don't, don't, don't. Don't try to move. Don't move. You're pretty banged up. You're a lucky man. It's a miracle that crash didn't kill you, Dr. Thorne. If your friend didn't find you an hour later, you would've died of exposure. - My friends? - Yeah. She got here not long after you left. Right in front of half the Indian Army. Can you give us a few minutes, please? See you later, Doc. Julia... I'm sorry. There's no reason to be sorry. No. I'm sorry for everything. I... Look at me. Look at me. Look at my life. I love what I do, and I never would have found this if I hadn't met you. And everything that happened, it taught me who I am. It showed me what I am capable of, and I... I am a survivor."
