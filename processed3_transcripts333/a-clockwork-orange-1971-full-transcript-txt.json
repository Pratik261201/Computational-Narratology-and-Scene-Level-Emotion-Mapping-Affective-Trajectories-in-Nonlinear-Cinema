A few of a certain Billy-boy's friends were ambulanced off late. Your name was mentioned. The words got to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Nobody can prove anything about anybody, as usual. I'm warning you, little Alex... ...being a good friend to you as always... ...the one man in this sore and sick community... ...who wants to save you from yourself! What gets into you all? We've been studying the problem for damn well near a century. But we get no farther with our studies. You got a good home here. Good, loving parents. You've got not too bad of a brain. ls it some devil that crawls inside of you? Nobody's got anything on me. I been out of the millicents' rockers for a long time. That's just what worries me. A bit too long to be safe. You're about due, by my reckoning. That's why I'm warning you... ...to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear? As an unmuddied lake, sir. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Ugh. Excuse me, brother. I ordered this two weeks ago. Can you see if it's arrived? Just a minute. Pardon me, ladies. Enjoying that, are you, my darling? A bit cold and pointless, isn't it, my lovely? What's happened to yours, my little sister? Who you getting, bratty? Goggly Gogol? Johnny Zhivago? The Heaven 17? What you got back home to play your fuzzy warbles on? I bet you've got little pitiful, portable picnic players. Come with Uncle and hear all proper. Hear angel trumpets and devil trombones. You are invited. - Hi, hi, hi, there. -Well, hello. He are here! He have arrived! Hooray! Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well! To what do I owe the extreme pleasure... ...of this surprising visit? We got worried. There we were, waiting and drinking at the old knifey moloko... ...and you had not turned up. And we thought you might have been, like... ...offended by something or other."

This young boy is a living witness to these diabolical proposals. The people, the common people, must know, must see. There are traditions of liberty to defend. The tradition of liberty is all. The common people will let it go, yes. They'll sell liberty for a quieter life. That is why they must be led. Driven, pushed. Fine. Thank you very much, sir. He'll be here. I 'm singing in the rain Just singing in the rain What a glorious feeling I'm happy again I'm laughing at clouds So dark up above The sun's in my heart And I'm ready for love Let the stormy clouds chase Everyone from the place Come on with the rain I've a smile on my face I'll walk down the lane To a happy refrain And I'm singing In the rain Good evening, sir. Good evening. It was very kind of you to leave this out for me. There was no one around, so I started. Hope that's all right, sir. Of course. Food all right? Great, sir. Great. Try the wine. Thank you, sir. Cheers. Happy days. -Won't you join me? -No. My health doesn't allow it. No, thank you. \"1960, Chéteau. Saint-Estéphe. Médoc.\" Very good brand. Very good... ...color. Smells nice too. Very nice little number. Well, here's to it. Very refreshing, sir. Very refreshing. I'm pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass. Thank you, sir. My wife... ...used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing. Your wife? ls she away? No. She's dead! I'm sorry to hear about that. She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by vicious young hoodlums... ...in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple, but for her the agony was too great. The doctors said it was pneumonia... ...because it happened later, during a flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age. Poor, poor girl. And now, you."
