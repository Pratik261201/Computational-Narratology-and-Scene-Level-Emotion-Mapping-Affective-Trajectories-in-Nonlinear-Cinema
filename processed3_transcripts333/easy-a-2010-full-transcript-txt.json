      "raw_text": "The rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated. I used to be anonymous, invisible to the opposite sex. If Google Earth were a guy... ...he couldn't find me if I was dressed up as a 10-story building. Pretty cutting-edge stuff, huh? A high school girl feeling anonymous. Who am I? What does it all mean? Why am I here? Blah. But don't worry, this isn't one of those tales. Though it sure started out that way. And then it changed pretty quickly when I started lying... ...about some very personal things. So let the record show that I, Olive Penderghast... ...being of sound mind, and below-average breast size... ...swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... ...and nothing but the truth. Starting now. And what better way to share my private thoughts... ...than to broadcast them on the Internet? So here it is. Part one. The shudder-inducing and cliched, however totally false account... ...of how I lost my virginity to a guy at a community college. Let me just begin by saying that there are two sides to every story. And this is my side, the right one. George is not a sexy name. George is what you name your teddy bear... ...not the name you wanna scream out during climax. And by that, I assume you mean? The stable and self-perpetuating end stage... ...in the evolution of a plant community. - Right. - Why, what were you thinking? The same. But I don't say it out loud lest someone get the wrong idea. I think you know innuendo is attached to everything these days. Innuendo? What...? Whatever do you mean? Rhiannon, Olive, go hit the books. They don't hit back. Also, hugs not drugs. Mess with the bull, get the horns. And any other cliches you can come up with. Bye, Mr. Griffith. Bye. - Watch your mouth. - Sorry. Mr. Griffith is my favorite teacher. Although, after all the trouble I caused... ...I don't know if I'm still his favorite student. You know, these are bad for you. It leads to unwanted pregnancy, all sorts of things. Mismatched tires on your vehicle, which is nonexistent. And here is where the trouble began. The lie that started the whole thing. Please, please, I'm begging you. I will pay you. I'll pay you. Rhi, I cannot go camping with you, okay? I'm sorry, but I have a date. - Okay? I told you. - With who? - You don't know him.",

Man, I would slit my throat... ...rather than say something to someone... ...that you didn't want me to say. - That's not necessary. - But that is comforting. - That's how I am, how I roll. That's how I do, as they say. - I like the pants. - Thank you. They're Costco. You can have them when you get taller. - I'm never gonna go through puberty. - Course you will. But we're a family of late bloomers. I didn't until I was 14. Nor did Olive. Why does that matter? I'm adopted. What? Oh, my God. Who told you? Guys, we were gonna do this at the right time.

Don't worry, I'm not nearly as smart as I think I am. So if we didn't do anything, could you still tell people we kissed? Absolutely. - Thanks, Olive. - Sure, Todd. I actually didn't wanna lie that time. When people thought I'd kissed someone, they didn't care. But when they thought I slept with someone... Hey, Olive. How's it going? I'm swell, Guy-I've-Never-Talked-to-Before. Thanks for asking. All I could think to myself was, \"Great, now I'm a tramp.\" I'm gonna have to get a lower-back tattoo... ...and pierce something not on my face. You guys know that I was here all weekend, right? - Yeah. - Yes, you were upstairs. - Yeah. - You would testify to that? - Yeah. - I would take a bullet for you. You know that. Right between the eyes. Man, I would slit my throat... ...rather than say something to someone... ...that you didn't want me to say. - That's not necessary. - But that is comforting. - That's how I am, how I roll. That's how I do, as they say. - I like the pants. - Thank you. They're Costco. You can have them when you get taller. - I'm never gonna go through puberty. - Course you will. But we're a family of late bloomers. I didn't until I was 14. Nor did Olive. Why does that matter? I'm adopted. What? Oh, my God. Who told you? Guys, we were gonna do this at the right time. Listen to me. Sometimes, even when a man and a woman love each other very much... ...like your mother and I used to..."

That's good, honey, but everything has spell check these days, so... Just kidding. Where are you from originally? So the next day I had detention... ...which, thanks to recent budget cuts, meant cleaning. I was looking forward to getting all this behind me. I had done the crime. I was gonna do the time. And that would be that, but that... Aren't there, like, child labor laws against this? Not in high school. The principal's like the captain of the ship in international waters. He can even marry people. We haven't talked in a while. How have you been, Brandon? Fabulous. I'm crushing it. Everything according to plan. I wanna be in detention. Yeah, why are you here? From the blood I saw gushing out of your nose, I thought you were bullied. Principal Gibbons is a homophobe, which is why I called him a fascist. - So the rumors are true. - I don't know what you're talking about. I meant about Gibbons being a fascist. So, what's with your new look? Very whore couture. Oh, haven't you heard? I'm the new school slut. You know, I did hear something. I also heard he was twice your age. Oh, no, no, no. No, he was a freshman in college. I also heard he gave you crabs. - People suck. - Tell me about it. He's not real. - What? - The guy I slept with. I made him up. Wait, you started the rumor? Indirectly, I guess sort of. Or actually, no. No, not really. No, I didn't. Well, but you're perpetuating it. That's really messed up. Excuse me? You're not even a real slut. You just want people to think you are. It's pathetic. No offense, but you could probably learn something from me, Brando. Are you saying that I should act straight so people will like me? That's groundbreaking. You should teach a course at The Learning Annex. It could be called \"The Painfully Obvious with Olive Penderghast... ...the Fake School Slut.\" I was just suggesting that maybe these kids we call peers... ...are onto something.

How don't I know any of this? The next night was the party at Melody Bostic's house. She is the most popular girl in school.

It's so hard because they keep doing it over and over again. Make me a promise. Make God a promise, right here and right now... ...that we will remain pure and chaste until marriage. We promise. Awesome, awesome, awesome. I love you guys. God loves you guys. Now, let's change lives today. - Micah? - Let's do it. I didn't know what they were so upset about. I put an A on my wardrobe just like they asked. Maybe it was because I was wearing clothes that were two sizes too small. Hey, Olive! You left your glass slipper at the party the other night. Yeah, and I got pumpkin all over my dress too. Nice. Solid joke. It sucks because we could've revisited Melody's bedroom. Oh, my God, that was Melody Bostic's house. - Yeah. - I can't believe you remember that. Well, yeah, come on. Who doesn't remember their first almost-kiss? Hey, Olive. Evan. Hey, what's rocking? Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, what's up? Don't get mad, but Brandon told me what you did for him. Oh, well, rest assured, it was equally as thrilling for me. No, he told me the truth. I was just hoping you could do the same for me? Goodbye, Evan. Wait, wait. I can pay you. I am about six seconds away from slapping you so hard... ...your teeth will bleed. - Can you do it in front of everyone? I don't need your permission, you know. What? I mean, at the rate you're going... ...I don't see how people won't believe it. - Are you threatening me? - I'll give you 100 bucks. You are repugnant. That's the problem."

I still can't believe you remember that. You know, sometimes I pretend you were my first real kiss. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Who was? - It was Rhiannon. - What? - She must have told you. Yeah, it was... I think it was, like, a year after that or something. It sucked, by the way. She was, like: That bitch. Oh, my God, she knew how I felt about you. - How do you feel about me? - And here I am feeling so bad. That's just perfect. Wait, hold on a second. How do you feel about me? \"Felt.\" I said \"felt.\" Because I thought I... I thought I heard \"feel.\" - No, it was \"felt.\" - All right. How do you know where I live? We used to carpool. Yeah, in 2nd grade. What, are you like a savant for people's addresses? Just for people who I think are cool. - You think I'm cool? - I do."
