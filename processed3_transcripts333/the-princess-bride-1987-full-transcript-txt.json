      "raw_text": "Ripped, patiently corrected & synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! Hi, honey. Hi, Mom. You feeling any better? A little bit. Guess what? What? Your grandfather's here. Mom, can't you tell him I'm sick? You're sick? That's why he's here. He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that. Maybe he won't. Hey, how is the sickie? I think I'll leave you two pals alone. I brought you a special present. What is it? Open it up. A book? That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you. Has it got any sports in it? Are you kidding? Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles. Doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake. Well, thank you very much. Very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right. \"The Princess Bride, \"by S. Morgenstern. \"Chapter one. \"Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin. \"Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse \"and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. \"His name was Westley, but she never called him that.\" Isn't that a wonderful beginning? Yeah, it's really good. \"Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.\" Farm Boy, polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning. As you wish. \" 'As you wish' was all he ever said to her.\" Farm Boy, fill these with water. Please? As you wish. \"That day, she was amazed to discover \"that when he was saying, 'As you wish,' \"what he meant was, 'I love you.' \"And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back.\" Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher. As you wish. Hold it. Hold it. What is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports? Is this a kissing book? Wait. Just wait. When does it get good? Keep your shirt on. Let me read. \"Westley had no money for marriage, \"so he packed his few belongings and left the farm \"to seek his fortune across the sea. \"It was a very emotional time for Buttercup.\" I don't believe this. I fear I'll never see you again. Of course you will. But what if something happens to you? Hear this now. I will always come for you. But how can you be sure?",

Do you think this happens every day? \"Westley didn't reach his destination. \"His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, \"who never left captives alive. \"When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered...\" Murdered by pirates is good. \"...she went into her room and shut the door. \"And for days, she neither slept nor ate.\" I will never love again. \"Five years later, the main square of Florin City \"was filled as never before \"to hear the announcement \"of the great Prince Humperdinck's bride-to-be.\" My people, a month from now, our country will have its 500th anniversary. On that sundown, I shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves. But perhaps you will not find her common now. Would you like to meet her? Yes!

We are but poor, lost circus performers. Is there a village nearby? There is nothing nearby, not for miles. Then there will be no one to hear you scream. What is that you're ripping? It is fabric from the uniform of an army officer of Guilder. Who is Guilder? The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. Go! Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the prince suspect that the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed. You never said anything about killing anyone. I've hired you to help me start a war. It's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition. I just don't think it's right killing an innocent girl. Am I going mad or did the word \"think\" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic landmass! I agree with Fezzik. The sot has spoken. What happens to her is not truly your concern. I will kill her. And remember this. Never forget this! When I found you, you were so slobbering drunk you couldn't buy brandy! And you! Friendless. Brainless. Helpless! Hopeless! Do you want me to send you back to where you were?",

We'll reach the cliffs by dawn. Why are you doing that? Are you sure nobody's follow us? That would be inconceivable. Despite what you think, you will be caught. And when you are, the Prince will see you all hanged. Of all the necks on this boat, Highness, the one you should be worrying about is your own. Stop doing that! We can all relax. It's almost over. You are sure nobody's follow us? As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally and in all other ways inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done and no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask? No reason.

Oh, my goodness. I did. I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. All right. All right. Let's see, she was in the water. The eel was coming after her. She was frightened.

He's climbing. Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us with the Princess and must, therefore, die. You, carry her. We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier. Catch up when he's dead. If he falls, fine. If not, the sword. I'm going to duel him left-handed. You know what a hurry we're in! It's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right, over too quickly. Oh, have it your way. You be careful. People in masks cannot be trusted. I'm waiting! Hello there! Slow going? Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me. - Sorry. - Thank you. I don't suppose you could speed things up? If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. I could do that. I've got some rope up here. But I do not think you would accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you. That does put a damper on our relationship. But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top. That's very comforting, but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait. I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard. No good. I've known too many Spaniards. Is there any way you'll trust me? Nothing comes to mind. I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive. Throw me the rope. Thank you. We'll wait... wait... wait until you're ready.",

He's climbing. Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us with the Princess and must, therefore, die. You, carry her. We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier. Catch up when he's dead. If he falls, fine. If not, the sword. I'm going to duel him left-handed. You know what a hurry we're in! It's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right, over too quickly. Oh, have it your way. You be careful. People in masks cannot be trusted. I'm waiting! Hello there! Slow going? Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me. - Sorry. - Thank you. I don't suppose you could speed things up? If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. I could do that. I've got some rope up here. But I do not think you would accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you. That does put a damper on our relationship. But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top. That's very comforting, but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait. I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard. No good. I've known too many Spaniards. Is there any way you'll trust me? Nothing comes to mind. I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive. Throw me the rope. Thank you. We'll wait... wait... wait until you're ready."

Is everything clear to you? We'll never succeed. We may as well die here. No. No. We have already succeeded. I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurt. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each. We can avoid that. Two, the lightning sand, but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future, we can avoid that, too. Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.s? Rodents Of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist. Westley! We did it. Now, was that so terrible? Surrender. You mean, you wish to surrender to me? Very well. I accept. I give you full marks for bravery. Don't make yourself a fool. But how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time, so whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit. I tell you once again, surrender! It will not happen. For the last time, surrender! Death first! Will you promise not to hurt him? What was that? What was that? If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man? May I live a thousand years and never hunt again. He is a sailor on the pirate ship Revenge. Promise to return him to his ship. I swear it will be done. Once we are out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair. I swear it will be done. I thought you were dead once, and it almost destroyed me. I could not bear it if you died again, not when I could save you. Come, sir. We must get you to your ship. We are men of action. Lies do not become us. Well spoken, sir. What is it? You have six fingers on your right hand. Someone was looking for you. Where am I? The Pit of Despair. Don't even think... Don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. Only the Prince, the Count and I know how to get in and out. Then I'm here till I die? Till they kill you, yeah. Then why bother curing me? The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken. So, it's to be torture?

        "Once the crew believed, he left the ship, and I have been Roberts ever since. Except, now that we're together, I shall retire and hand the name over to someone else. Is everything clear to you? We'll never succeed. We may as well die here. No. No. We have already succeeded. I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurt. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each. We can avoid that. Two, the lightning sand, but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future, we can avoid that, too. Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.s? Rodents Of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist. Westley! We did it. Now, was that so terrible? Surrender. You mean, you wish to surrender to me? Very well. I accept. I give you full marks for bravery. Don't make yourself a fool. But how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time, so whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit. I tell you once again, surrender! It will not happen. For the last time, surrender! Death first! Will you promise not to hurt him? What was that? What was that? If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man? May I live a thousand years and never hunt again. He is a sailor on the pirate ship Revenge. Promise to return him to his ship. I swear it will be done. Once we are out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair. I swear it will be done. I thought you were dead once, and it almost destroyed me. I could not bear it if you died again, not when I could save you. Come, sir. We must get you to your ship. We are men of action. Lies do not become us. Well spoken, sir. What is it? You have six fingers on your right hand. Someone was looking for you. Where am I? The Pit of Despair. Don't even think... Don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. Only the Prince, the Count and I know how to get in and out. Then I'm here till I die? Till they kill you, yeah. Then why bother curing me? The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken. So, it's to be torture? I can cope with torture."

And remember, this is for posterity, so be honest. How do you feel? Interesting. Yellin. Sire. As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret.

Every ship but the four you sent. Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four. Your Majesty. You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway. You're a silly girl. Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you are nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear. I would not say such things if I were you. Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that, not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it, not with a thousand swords. And when I say you're a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling... ever to crawl the earth! I would not say such things if I were you! You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so, I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will. Not to 50! Fezzik. Fezzik, listen. Do you hear? That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father. The man in black makes it now. The man in black? His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has the cause for ultimate suffering? Excuse me. Pardon me, it's important. Fezzik, please. Everybody, move! Thank you. Where is the man in black? You get there from this grove, yes? Fezzik, jog his memory. I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't meant to jog him so hard. Inigo? Father, I have failed you for 20 years. Now, our misery can end. Somewhere... Somewhere close by is a man who can help us. I cannot find him alone. I need you. I need you to guide my sword. Please. Guide my sword. He's dead. Just is not fair. Grandpa, Grandpa, wait. Wait. What did Fezzik mean, \"He's dead\"? I mean, he didn't mean \"dead.\" Westley's only faking, right? You want me to read this or not? Who gets Humperdinck? I don't understand. Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end? Somebody's gotta do it. Is it Inigo? Who? Nobody. Nobody kills him.",

All your worst nightmares... are about to come true! Then love, true love, will follow you... forever. The Dread Pirate Roberts... is here for your souls! Stay where you are! Stand and fight. Stay where you are! So treasure your love... Skip to the end. Have you the ring? Here comes my Westley now. Fezzik, the portcullis! Your Westley is dead. I killed him myself.
