I've never heard of that, but okay. You're trying to use your eHarmony account for the first time? I am. Okay. I'm looking at your profile. We have a pretty intricate matching algorithm. That's what distinguishes us from other online dating services. Yeah, I like that. Actually, I'm just trying to leave a wink for one person. Cheryl Melhoff? She started in my division at work about a month ago, and I overheard her near the bagels saying she was on your site. Okay, that's unique, but let me ask you, you left a lot of this stuff, like... like the \"Been There, Done That\" section, you left it blank. Yeah, I think I skipped it. Okay, well, you got to help me out here, man. Don't skip stuff. Okay, well, I haven't really been anywhere... noteworthy or mentionable. Have you... have you done anything noteworthy, mentionable? Hello? You still there? Can you hang on a second? My God! Go, go, go! Get out! Get out! She's gonna blow! Go! Go! Chips! Over here! Chips! Thank you! How'd you know about the building? I heard barking, thought I smelled gas. I hope it's okay. I engineered a prosthesis for Chips while I was sprinting down the stairwell. Little hip-joint assembly with a drop-ring lock and an anterior pelvic band. God, you're noteworthy. I just live by the ABCs. Adventurous, brave, creative. That's everything I want in a man. My man? Hey, my man, you still there? Hey. What, did you pass out or...? No, I just, like, zoned out for a second. Okay. Do you do that a lot? A normal amount, I guess. Yeah... I... I got to run. Sorry. O-Okay, but we... we need a lot more... Hey, bad day to be late. We just got acquired. What? Yeah, over the weekend. Walter, happy birthday! He's 42 years old! Odessa, what are you doing here? Mom made you your favorite clementine cake. Aren't you supposed to be at the retirement place with her getting the piano moved in? Yes, I was there. It's, like, halfway done. Piano is out of the van, it's on the street. Everything's fine, but I just got a phone call about a really big audition, so can you go finish it? No, I can't; I'm late. Walter, I... I don't think you're seeing this from what I need.",

Also, we feel sad about that, as you can see. Now, for some good news. We are very excited for... All right, Don. Ted Hendricks, managing director of the transition. Never fun, this stage. But we do have ahead of us the privilege of publishing what will be the very last issue of LIFE magazine.

What's that? Major Tom. Can I, get that? It's, being processed. All right, well, let's do it. Let's process some quintessence. Come on. Go. Now. That's why I'm clapping. Wait, when do we go to press? Two and a half weeks. Please don't worry. You're going to be fine, okay? You've been here forever; I'm sure he won't... Don't worry, it's gonna be fine. It was nice talking to you. Well, guess I'll talk to you later. Okay. Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm, Walter. Cheryl. Mitty. Melhoff. Yes, You... you work in Photo Accounts, right? I do. Negative Assets. Yes. I'm... Yeah. Processing the last cover photo. That's-that's a big deal. Yeah, it's... there's... We have a glitch. Mini on that one right now. I wanted to say to you, do you maybe have an address for Sean O'Connell? Um, it's not really that easy with him. He moves around so much. I don't. Yeah, he's on a freelance. I don't know where, and he doesn't have a phone. No phone? He's old-school. Yeah. Well... Um, but, you know, um, why don't I check with Peg? I know she just processed a check for him, and we could track his payout, maybe, find him that way? Cool. Very cool. Okay. Okay. Walter. - Yes. - All right. All right. I'm on it. Okay. Thanks. Yes, okay. Are you coming? Yes, I'm not. Yes, I have to stay. Here's the contact sheet. What do you see? This photo cluster, these three, they're the only printable ones. He took them around the same time he took 25. They could give us a clue to where Sean is. Blow them up, all right? Cool. Hey. Walter, right? Yeah. So I called Peg about Sean. She's gonna get back to me. Hey, thanks. Cool glasses. Very Sand People. These? These are... No, these are loupes. They're for work. They magnify the... Is that 25? Can I see? That's, no.

It means, like, the fullest and most rich. Okay. So our cover will probably be the most famous ever because it really will have the big quintessence of all time. Very full and so rich. So let's see this thing? Let's see it. Can we... What do we... What am I doing up here? What's going on? We'll receive it now from Negative Assets. This gentleman here. Negative Assets. Last man in. What's that? Major Tom. Can I, get that? It's, being processed. All right, well, let's do it. Let's process some quintessence. Come on. Go. Now. That's why I'm clapping. Wait, when do we go to press? Two and a half weeks. Please don't worry. You're going to be fine, okay? You've been here forever; I'm sure he won't... Don't worry, it's gonna be fine. It was nice talking to you. Well, guess I'll talk to you later. Okay. Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm, Walter. Cheryl. Mitty. Melhoff. Yes, You... you work in Photo Accounts, right? I do. Negative Assets. Yes. I'm... Yeah. Processing the last cover photo. That's-that's a big deal. Yeah, it's... there's... We have a glitch. Mini on that one right now. I wanted to say to you, do you maybe have an address for Sean O'Connell? Um, it's not really that easy with him. He moves around so much. I don't. Yeah, he's on a freelance. I don't know where, and he doesn't have a phone. No phone? He's old-school. Yeah. Well... Um, but, you know, um, why don't I check with Peg? I know she just processed a check for him, and we could track his payout, maybe, find him that way? Cool. Very cool. Okay. Okay. Walter. - Yes. - All right. All right. I'm on it. Okay. Thanks. Yes, okay. Are you coming? Yes, I'm not. Yes, I have to stay. Here's the contact sheet. What do you see? This photo cluster, these three, they're the only printable ones. He took them around the same time he took 25. They could give us a clue to where Sean is. Blow them up, all right? Cool. Hey. Walter, right? Yeah. So I called Peg about Sean. She's gonna get back to me. Hey, thanks. Cool glasses. Very Sand People. These? These are... No, these are loupes. They're for work. They magnify the... Is that 25? Can I see? That's, no. I can't quite find 25 just now."

No. Any acquaintances? Okay. Any companions? Anybody here who might be able to verify that you're Walter Mitty? Walter Mitty? Yeah. Todd Maher, eHarmony. Hey. Thank you. Thanks. I really... What? Come here, come here. Backpack. Big hug! Airport prison? Yeah. Yeah? Tell me all about it over a Cinnabon. Come on, Cinnabon. How long were you detained for, by the way? Like, 17 hours. Wow. How's that Cinnabon taste? Really great. That's like... That's frosted heroin. That's what you're eating. My friend, that's what you're having right there, man. It's good.

Too playful. I see what you're saying. With the cover, I should have been more straightforward. But can I ask you? I mean, if you don't mind... what did you do with the wallet? Chucked it. Well, that hurts my feelings. No... man, I liked it very much. I appreciated it very much. So you threw it away? I... So you have no idea what it was. The photograph. It's a shame. It was a beauty. How'd you find me, anyway? My mom. Cool lady. Knows how to bake. Yeah. Hey, why did you...? Shh. When are you gonna take it? Sometimes I don't. If I like a moment... I mean, me, personally...
