Just a second. There you are. Nothing personal. Well, I guess that wraps it up. Good work, everybody. Marty, I couldn't be happier with the way this worked out. Congratulations. Hold that. Gee, thanks. Thanks for pushing that, Bob. The light's on, but you never know, it might be broken. Shut up. Remember, honey... Jesus. Bob, what button did you push? Mr. Bagwell, make sure these other elevators remain locked down and empty. There's no doors, no other way in or out, except through access panels, correct? What we have here are 13 passengers in an express elevator below floor 30. Bomb's taken out cables. Bomber wants $3 million or he blows the brakes. - What's our clock? - He gave one hour. That leaves us 23 minutes exactly. Anything to keep this elevator from falling? The basement. We'd like to avoid that, Traven. - We can't unload the passengers? - This is an express elevator. The only way in is through access panels. The bomber's wired the hatch, which seats him in the \"crazy but not stupid\" section. Sir, Harry volunteers to examine the device. - Yeah, right. - Fine. The two of you check it out. The nearest access panel's on the 32nd floor in the lobby. I want reports only. We're in a holding pattern. Worthy, Briggs, secure the base area. Everyone else, I want you to affirm building evac. Move! Looks like we're walkin'. - Hurry, but watch your step! - 29. All the way down to the lobby! Let's go, folks! 30. 31. 32. Hello? - Come on! Get us outta here! - Hello! Hello! Help! Please, get us out of here! Please! Please! Get us out of here! Who's up there? Who's up there? What's going on? Ladies and gentlemen, this is the LAPD. - Thank God. - What are you doing up there? There's been an elevator malfunction, so just relax. Hey, come on! What are you guys waiting for? We'll have you out of there as soon as possible. Am I lying? How come they sent cops here? Shouldn't they send repair guys? What do you think? - You're the expert. I just work here. - Looks pretty solid. - Anyone we know? - I don't recognise the work, but he's a pro. - He's cutting it close. - I don't like it. Well, what's to like?",

Shoot the hostage. - What? - Take her out of the equation. Go for the good wound and he can't get to the plane with her. Clear shot. You're deeply nuts, you know that? \"Shoot the hostage.\" Harry, this is wrong. He's gonna blow it anyway. - Why? - I don't know. Gut feeling. Right now Mac outranks your gut, so we sit. This is taking way too long. How much d'you think that elevator weighs? Jack, come on. Maybe we can do something about those hostages. We're not gonna shoot 'em, right? Hey, where you going? What's going on? Don't go! Don't leave us here! No, we just take them out of the equation. - Are you sure it'll hold? - It'll hold. Six minutes. I can't get any more time. He's not talking! I need the goddamn money now. Tell me again, Harry. Why did I take this job? Oh, come on. 30 more years of this, you get a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch. Cool. - God, it's hot in here. - There's no air. - Can't they just pry the doors open? - I can't breathe. Don't fuck with Daddy. Usually they fall down now. He's early. The son of a bitch is early! Mac, we need more help up here now! Oh, please! I don't wanna die! Please save us! Open the door! Open the door, please! - Please help me! - We'll get you out! - Give me your hands! It's OK. - Pull me through. Watch your head. Watch your head. - OK, I've got you. - Take it easy. - You're fine. You're fine. - Thank you. - Take her. - Who's next? Thank you. We've got you, ma'am. - What the hell is all this? - Help us! Hurry! Hurry, hurry! Let's go! Go! Go! Come on. Come on. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Help me out! Please, help me out. - Watch your head. - Come on, lady! - No. Come on, lady! Come on! Grab my hand! - Come on! Let's go! It's going to fall! - No! No, I can't! Just take one step, reach out and take my hand. Come on! Come on! - Oh, God! Don't let go of me! - You're OK. My shoe! Was it good for you? It was great for me. How was it for you, honey? - Elevator dropped. - Good. That's good to know. - Is your watch slow? - No. He jumped the gun. - We had three minutes left. - Why does he do that? He's losing his $3 million. Maybe he couldn't hold his wad long enough. It's a common problem among middle-aged men.",

I don't suppose anybody'll give me three million just for you. Hold it! Pop quiz, hotshot. Terrorist holding a police hostage. Got enough dynamite strapped to his chest to blow a building in half. Now what do you do? There's gonna be 50 cops waiting for you in the basement. Standard flanking deployment, right? Maybe we'll get off on the third floor, huh? At least that's what they'll think. I want location on those goddamn shots! Briggs! Where's Jack and Harry? Lieutenant, we've got movement on the freight elevator. It's on three. Let's move! End of the line. This day has been real disappointing, I don't mind saying. Because you didn't kill everyone? There will come a time, boy, when you'll wish you'd never met me. Mister, I'm already there. I'm in charge here. I drop this stick and they pick your friend up with a sponge. - Are you ready to die, friend? - Fuck you. In 200 years, we've come from \"I regret but I have one life to give for my country\" to \"fuck you\"? - Go ahead. Drop the stick. Do it. - Shut up, Harry. We've got all the balls in the world right here, man. Give it up. You got nowhere to go! Shoot the hostage. Say goodbye, Harry. You fuck! Freeze! Freeze! Give it up! You're out of options! Through dedication and bravery, these next two officers effected the rescue of 13 citizens of this city. And, thanks to them, the only life taken by the terrorist's bomb was his own. You shot me. I can't believe it. They're giving you a medal for shooting me, you little prick. Harry, you told me to. ...the Los Angeles Police Department. Officer Harry Temple. Officer Jack Traven.

And to Jack, for shooting Harry. Something we've all wanted to do for a very long time. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! OK, no, no. Here it is. Here's to you guys for doing your job and for not getting dead. Mazel tov. We are the two luckiest guys in the world. We got the bad guy and we didn't lose any civilians. - We're good. - No. You were lucky. No, we were lucky. You'd better understand it. We were dealing with a total psycho. This guy could've blown us up at any time. And I got a bullet in me. Six inches off the mark, and they're giving the medal to my wife. Harry, come on, man. I mean, we won. We got him. Do you listen? Do you ever? Because I am not gonna be around to back you up, so you better start thinking. Guts'll get you so far, and then they'll get you killed. Luck runs out sooner or later. Right, Chief? That's right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm gonna go home, have some sex. - Harry, you're gonna go home and puke. - Yeah, well, that'll be fun, too. Come on, you gimp. Hey, Jack, saw you on TV. Congratulations. Thanks, Bob. - You looked fat. - Take it easy on him, Bob. - The boy was up late last night partying. - Wild party, huh? I don't remember that well. Couldn't have been too great.

Something we've all wanted to do for a very long time. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! OK, no, no. Here it is. Here's to you guys for doing your job and for not getting dead. Mazel tov. We are the two luckiest guys in the world. We got the bad guy and we didn't lose any civilians. - We're good. - No. You were lucky. No, we were lucky. You'd better understand it. We were dealing with a total psycho. This guy could've blown us up at any time. And I got a bullet in me. Six inches off the mark, and they're giving the medal to my wife. Harry, come on, man. I mean, we won. We got him. Do you listen? Do you ever? Because I am not gonna be around to back you up, so you better start thinking. Guts'll get you so far, and then they'll get you killed. Luck runs out sooner or later. Right, Chief? That's right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm gonna go home, have some sex. - Harry, you're gonna go home and puke. - Yeah, well, that'll be fun, too. Come on, you gimp. Hey, Jack, saw you on TV. Congratulations. Thanks, Bob. - You looked fat. - Take it easy on him, Bob. - The boy was up late last night partying. - Wild party, huh? I don't remember that well. Couldn't have been too great. Woke up alone. Yeah? The last time I partied like that, I woke up married, huh, Vinnie?

The bus came onto the freeway at the Lincoln onramp. It began picking up speed, swerving, and hasn't slowed down since. Minutes ago a police officer boarded the bus by jumping onto it from a moving car. Would that be you, Jack? - Where do we start? - The speedometer. Has it been fucked with or loosened? See any wires or anything? Excuse me, ma'am. No, it's clean. Then it's gonna be under the bus. Probably rigged to one of the axles. I can't get under the bus right now. It's kind of in motion. Excuse me! Excuse me! Hold on. Access panel... in the floor. Underneath you, man. All right, Harry. We're in. Passenger relay. Sir, take this. I want you to tell him what I see. OK. We got a wad! Pretty big! - There's a pretty big wad. - Brass fittings! - Brass fittings. - I think I can reach the circuit wire. - He can reach the circuit wire. - No, don't. That's a decoy. Classic. - Classic decoy. - What else? - What else? - Hold on. Hold on. Fuck me! Oh, darn. Harry, there's enough C4 on this thing to put a hole in the world. OK, all right. Just stay calm. What else?

It's like driving a really big Pinto. - I need to know! Can you handle it? - I'm fine. Just tell me what the plan is. - Is there a plan? - For you to drive. We're OK for now. - Just keep us above 50. - Good plan. - So, you're a cop, right? - That's right. Well, I should probably tell you that I had my driver's license revoked. - What for? - Speeding. Harry, we're on our way to the chopper. If anything changes, let us know. Anything we haven't seen should be in here. ...wrong with the driver, but at least one car, a Jaguar, has been driven off the road by the speeding bus. The bus came onto the freeway at the Lincoln onramp. It began picking up speed, swerving, and hasn't slowed down since. Minutes ago a police officer boarded the bus by jumping onto it from a moving car. Would that be you, Jack? - Where do we start? - The speedometer. Has it been fucked with or loosened? See any wires or anything? Excuse me, ma'am. No, it's clean. Then it's gonna be under the bus. Probably rigged to one of the axles. I can't get under the bus right now. It's kind of in motion. Excuse me! Excuse me! Hold on. Access panel... in the floor. Underneath you, man. All right, Harry. We're in. Passenger relay. Sir, take this. I want you to tell him what I see. OK. We got a wad! Pretty big! - There's a pretty big wad. - Brass fittings! - Brass fittings. - I think I can reach the circuit wire. - He can reach the circuit wire. - No, don't. That's a decoy. Classic. - Classic decoy. - What else? - What else? - Hold on. Hold on. Fuck me! Oh, darn. Harry, there's enough C4 on this thing to put a hole in the world. OK, all right. Just stay calm. What else? Three triggers -one on the axle I can't really see, a cellular remote and a timer running off a wristwatch. - A watch?"

Freeze! Pop quiz, asshole. You have a hair trigger aimed at your head. What do you do? What do you do? Turn around. Turn around! - Oh, no. - I'm sorry. Be prepared. It's the Boy Scout marching song. What are you gonna do, Jack? I don't think you can shoot her. Let her go. No, I don't think I'm gonna do that. Fill it. Now. I think Harry would be very disappointed, feeling that we're right back where we started. Let her go. You don't need her. You have the money. Take it and walk. Come on. Just take it and walk. You don't need her. - Just take your goddamn money and walk! - Stay right there. I'll do it. I'll let go. I'll let go. Oh, yeah. You still don't get it, do you, Jack? Huh? The beauty of it. A bomb is made to explode. That's its meaning, its purpose. Your life is empty because you spend it trying to stop the bomb from becoming. And for who? For what? Do you know what a bomb is, Jack, that doesn't explode? It is a cheap gold watch, buddy. You're crazy. You're fucking crazy. No. Poor people are crazy, Jack. I'm eccentric. Get the money. Let's go. Come on! Let's go! Move it! Move it! You stay! Move it! Move it! In the door. In that door! Now! Bye, Jack. Punk. All right! Get in there. Go on, get in. You get back in there! You get this train moving! Go on! Are these seats taken? No. Go. Come on. Back over here. Hands around the pole. Damn. Come on, come on, come on! Please report, Westbound 501. What is your position? Westbound 501, please check in. Westbound 501. We have police orders to return to the station. Do you copy? You have to hold this. It's like a grenade. You have to help me now. Come on, hold it. Don't let it go. Huh? I'm counting on you. Do you copy? Hey! I'll take it from here. Maybe you'd better let me have this after all. I'm afraid you're a bit hysterical and you might let this go a mite early. Hey! Hey, buckaroo! It's not cos you're a woman, all right? Hey, it's all right. Looks like we're all alone. You won. You beat Jack. You beat everybody. Just throw me off the train. I don't care. This stick works on a remote. When you explode, that's where they'll come, but it's not where I'll be.",
