Have you seen anything strange? Is he shitting me? Visions. Visions. Have you seen any visions like that? The Omega senses when it's losing control... ...of its power. Even now it's mentally searching to find you. RITA: When it's close to finding you... ...you will start having visions. You'll start to see that. You'll even see where it is. And you had these visions? Yes. But eventually you saw it. I mean, you actually saw it. Right? Never in the flesh. So this is all just some... ...theory. You don't know if this thing even exists. The visions showed me it was at Verdun. I could see it. I-- I just... ...lost the power before I could get to it. CARTER: And by the time we took... ...Verdun... ...the Omega was gone. Okay. So all I have to do is... ...wait to have these visions... ...and then tell you where this Omega thing is. No. Cage. You're gonna get me there. And I'm gonna kill it. Get you there? I'm not even trained for combat. COMPUTER: Reload. Reload."
