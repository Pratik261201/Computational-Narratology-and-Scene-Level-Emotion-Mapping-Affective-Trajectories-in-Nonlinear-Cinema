What a night, ladies and gentlemen! Every star in Hollywood's heaven is here... to make Monumental Pictures' premiere of 'The Royal Rascal'... the outstanding event of 1927. Everyone is breathlessly awaiting... the arrival of Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood. Look who's arriving now! It's that famous Zip Girl of the screen... the darling of the flapper set, Zelda Zanders. Zelda! Oh, Zelda! With her new red-hot pash, J. Cumberland Spendrill III... that well-known eligible bachelor. Zelda's had so much unhappiness. I hope this time it's really love. And here comes that exotic star, Olga Mara... and her new husband, the Baron de la Bonnet de la Toulon. They've been married two months already... but still as happy as newlyweds. Well, well, well. It's Cosmo Brown! Cosmo is Don Lockwood's best friend. He plays the piano for Don and Lina to get them into those romantic moods. Oh, folks, this is it! The stars of tonight's picture, those romantic lovers of the screen... Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont! Ladies and gentlemen, when you look at this gorgeous couple... it's no wonder they're a household name all over the world... like bacon and eggs. Lockwood and Lamont. Don, you can tell me confidentially... are these rumors true that wedding bells are soon to ring for you and Lina? Lina and I have no statement to make right now. We're just good friends. You've come a long way together, Don. Won't you tell us how it all happened? Well, Lina and I have made a number of pictures together... No, no, Don. I want your story from the beginning. Dora, not in front of all these people. Yes! But, Don, the story of your success is an inspiration... to young people all over the world. - Please. - Yes! Well, to begin with, any story of my career... would have to include my lifelong friend, Cosmo Brown! We were kids together, grew up together, worked together. Yes? Well, Dora, I've had one motto which I've always lived by: Dignity. Always dignity. This was instilled in me by Mom and Dad from the very beginning.",

They used to make such a fuss over me. If I was good, I was allowed to accompany Mom and Dad to the theater. They brought me up on Shaw, Moliere... the finest of the classics. To this was added musical training at the Conservatory of Fine Arts. We rounded out our apprenticeship... at the most exclusive dramatics academy. And at all times... the motto remained: Dignity. Always dignity. In a few years, Cosmo and I embarked on a dance concert tour. We played the finest symphonic halls in the country. Fit as a fiddle and ready for love I can jump over the moon up above Fit as a fiddle and ready for love Haven't a worry, haven't a care Feel like a feather that's floatin' on air Fit as a fiddle and ready for love Soon the church bells will be ringin' And a march with Ma and Pa All the church bells will be ringin' With a hey-nonny-nonny and a hot-cha-cha Hi-diddle-diddle, my baby's okay Ask me a riddle, I'm happy to say Fit as a fiddle and ready for love Audiences everywhere adored us. Finally, we decided to come to sunny California. We were stranded... We were staying here when the offers from movie studios started pouring in. We sorted them out and decided to favor Monumental Pictures. Okay, Lina, you hate him. Keep that mood music going. Phil, you come in. Keep on grinding. Now you see her. Now here's the bit, Bert, where you get it on the jaw. Cut! No, no! That wasn't right, Bert! You were supposed to go over the bar and crash into the glasses! Try it again, okay, Bert? Bert! Oh, that's just swell! Take him away, fellas. You'll be all right, Bert. We've lost more darn stuntmen on this picture! It'll take hours to get a new one over from central casting! Mr. Dexter, I can do that. - You're a musician! - That's a moot point. No kidding! What's your name? Don Lockwood, sir, but the fellas call me Donald. Wise guy, huh? Okay, I'll try you. Get this guy into Bert's suit! And remember, Lockwood, you might be trading that fiddle in for a harp! Camera! Phil, come in! Now you see him! Here's where you get it right on the jaw! Cut! That was wonderful! You got any more little chores you want done?",

A real lady. Hello, Miss Lamont. I'm Don Lockwood, the stuntman. It was sure a thrill working with you, Miss Lamont. Don, I want you to meet the producer of the picture, Mr. R.F. Simpson. I just saw some rushes for the picture and asked Dexter who the stuntmen were. He told me they were all you. I'm putting you and Lina together in a picture. Come to my office. - We'll discuss a contract. - Thanks, Mr. Simpson! Are you doing anything tonight, Miss Lamont? Well, that's funny. I'm busy. Lina and I have had the same wonderful relationship ever since. But most important of all, I continue living up to my motto: Dignity. Always dignity. Thank you, Don. And I'm sure you and Lina will continue making movie history tonight... in your greatest picture, 'The Royal Rascal.' Get enough, boys? She's so refined. I think I'll kill myself. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We're pretty darn thrilled at your response to 'The Royal Rascal.' We had fun making it, and we hope you had fun seeing it tonight. We screen actors aren't much good at speaking in public... so we'll just act out our thanks. It's a smash, eh, Mr. Simpson? It's a smash, eh, Mr. Simpson? - Don. Lina, you were gorgeous. - You look pretty good for a girl. For heaven's sake, what's the big idea? Can't a girl get a word in edgewise? After all, they're my public too! The publicity department, Rod here, thought it would be much better... if Don made the speeches for the team. Why? You're a beautiful woman. Audiences think you've got a voice to match. The studio's gotta keep their stars from looking ridiculous at any cost. - No one's got that much money. - What's wrong with the way I talk? What's the big idea? Am I dumb or something? No. It's just that Don's had so much more experience... Next time, write me out a speech. I could memorize it. Why don't you go out now and recite the Gettysburg Address? What do you know about it, you piano player? Are you anybody? Donnie, how can you let him talk to me like that, your fianc?e? My fian... Now, Lina, you've been reading those fan magazines again.",

This car hasn't given me trouble for six hours. There's Don Lockwood! - Give me your autograph! - Hi, kids! I want a souvenir! - I want a souvenir too! - Hold on there! You're tearing my... Hey, Cos, call me a cab! Okay, you're a cab. Thanks a lot! - Lady, keep driving. - Get out of here! - I'll call the police! - Don't do that. - Don't hurt me! - I'm not a criminal. You are a criminal! I've seen that face before. - You're a famous gangster! - Let me explain... I've seen your picture in the post office. Officer! This man jumped into my car... - Why, it's Don Lockwood! - Don Lockwood? - Out for a joyride? - Just a lift, Officer. My car broke down, I got surrounded... You're a lucky lady. Anything wrong? - Why, no. - I should think not. Good night. Good night, Officer. Well, thanks for saving my life. I'll get out now. I'm driving to Beverly Hills. Can I drop you someplace? I'd like to get out of this torn suit if you're going by Camden and Sunset. Yes, I am. I'd very much like to know whose hospitality I'm enjoying. Selden. Kathy Selden. Enchanted, Miss Selden. I'm sorry I frightened you. I was getting a little too much love from my adoring fans. Oh, that's what you were running away from. They did that to you? That's terrible. Yes, it is, isn't it? It is terrible. Well, we movie stars get the glory. I guess we have to take the little heartaches that go with it. People think we lead lives of glamour and romance..."

I don't remember. I saw one once. - You saw one once? - You were dueling. There was a girl, Lina Lamont. Though I don't go to the movies much. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. - Thank you. - No offense. Movies are entertaining enough for the masses... but the personalities on the screen just don't impress me. They don't talk, they don't act. They just make a lot of dumb show. Well, you know. Like that. You mean, like what I do? Well, yes. Well, yes. Here we are, Sunset and Camden. Wait a minute. You mean, I'm not an actor? - Pantomime on the screen isn't acting? - Of course not. Acting means great parts, wonderful lines, speaking those glorious words. - Words. - Shakespeare, Ibsen. What's your lofty mission in life that lets you sneer at my humble profession? Well, I'm an actress. On the stage. Oh, on the stage. I'd like to see you act. What are you in now? I could brush up on my English or bring along an interpreter... if they'd let in a movie actor. I'm not in a play now, but I will be. I'm going to New York... You're going to New York. Someday we'll all hear of you, won't we? Kathy Selden as Juliet, as Lady Macbeth, as King Lear. You'll have to wear a beard for that one. Laugh if you want to, but at least the stage is a dignified profession. What are you so conceited about? You're nothing but a shadow on film. You're not flesh and blood. - Stop! - Why? I'm only a shadow. Just because you're a big movie star... you expect every girl to fall in a dead faint at your feet! Well, don't you touch me! Fear not, sweet lady. I will not molest you. I am but a humble jester... and you are too far above me. Farewell, Ethel Barrymore. I must tear myself from your side. - Is this R.F. Simpson's house? - Yes, miss. - I'm from the Coconut Grove. - Around the back, please. I see. Thank you. - Nice party, R.F. - Thanks, Roscoe. Mr. Brown, do you really think you could get me in the movies? - I should think so. - Really? There's Don! I loved the picture tonight. - Don, did you come by way of Australia? - Hello, Cos.",

Anyway, to get back to the main point... you and Miss Lamont do achieve an intimacy in all your pictures... Did you say all my pictures? I guess now that I think of it, I've seen eight or nine of them. Eight or nine. It seems to me I remember someone saying... 'If you've seen one, you've seen 'em all.' I did say some awful things that night, didn't I? No. I deserved them. Of course, I must admit I was pretty much upset by them. So upset that I haven't been able to think of anything but you ever since. Honest? Honest. Well, I've been pretty upset too. Kathy, look. Seeing you again, now that I... Kathy, I'm trying to say something to you, but I... I'm such a ham. I guess I'm not able to without the proper setting. - What do you mean? - Well... Come here. This is the proper setting. Why, it's just an empty stage. At first glance, yes. But wait a second. A beautiful sunset. Mist from the distant mountains. Colored lights in a garden.

I am the noblest lady of the court, second only to the queen... yet I am the saddest of the mortals in France. What is the matter, my lady? I'm so downhearted, Theresa. My father has me betrothed to the Baron de Landsfield... and I can't stand 'im. But he is such a catch. All the ladies of the court wish they were in your pretty shoes. My heart belongs to another. Pierre de Battaille. Ever since I met him, I can't get 'im outta my mind. Sounds good and loud, huh? Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't have... You're flirting with danger. They will surely... ...too valuable. She never could remember where the microphone was, boss. 'Tis Cupid himself that called me here, and I... smitten by his arrow... The night is full of our enemies. Hey, Lina, whatcha hittin' him with, a blackjack? I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Did somebody get paid for writing that dialogue? Sounds like a comedy inside. - It's a Lockwood-Lamont talkie. - What? This is terrible. What's that? The sound. It's out of synchronization! - Tell them to fix it! - Yes, sir. What's this? Yvonne, captured by Rouge Noir of the Purple Terror? Oh! Oh, my sword! I must fly to her side. Yvonne, Yvonne, my own! Pierre will save me! Pierre! Pierre is miles away, you wench! No, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! No, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! No... no... no! This is a scream. This is a scream. Give me pictures like 'The Jazz Singer.' I love you! I love you! We're all ruined. - You can't release this picture. - We've got to. We're booked to open in six weeks all over the country. But you're such big stars, we might get by. I never want to see Lockwood and Lamont again. - Wasn't that awful? - This is the worst picture ever made. I liked it. Take a last look at it. It'll be up for auction in the morning. You're out of your mind. Besides, it's Saturday. No bank's gonna foreclose until Monday. - It wasn't so bad. - That's what I've been telling him. There's no use kidding myself. Once they release 'The Dueling Cavalier'..."

Don't bring a frown to Old Broadway Ah, you gotta clown on Broadway Your troubles there They're out of style For Broadway always wears a smile A million lights They flicker there A million hearts beat quicker there No skies of gray on that Great White Way That's the Broadway Melo-dy Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Shh! Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Broadway rhythm It's got me Everybody dance Broadway rhythm It's got me Everybody dance Out on that gay White Way In each merry cafe Orchestras play Takin' your breath away Broadway rhythm, it's got me Everybody sing and dance That Broadway rhythm That Broadway rhythm When I hear that happy beat Feel like dancin' down the street That Broadway rhythm Writhing, beating Rhythm Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance When I hear that happy beat Feel like dancin' down the street When I hear that happy beat Feel like dancin' down the street When I hear that happy beat Feel like dancing down the street Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance Gotta dance That's the Broadway Melo-dy That's the idea of the number."

If we bring a little joy into your humdrum lives... it makes us feel as though our hard work ain't been in vain for nothin'. Bless you all! She didn't sound that way in the picture. Cut the talk, Lina. Sing! I got an idea. What am I gonna do? We've got it. Rod, set up a microphone back of that curtain. Kathy, come here. Kathy will stand back there and sing for you. She'll be back of the curtain singing, and I'll be out in front doing... like in the picture? - That's right. - What? You gotta do it. This thing is too big. Of course she's got to do it. She's got a contract. - Get over to that microphone. - You heard him. Do it! I'll do it, Don... but I never want to see you again, on or off the screen. Come on, Lina. What are you going to sing, Miss Lamont? 'Singing In The Rain.' 'Singing In The Rain.' 'Singing In The Rain.' In what key? 'A' flat. 'A' flat. In 'A' flat. I'm singin' in the rain Just singin' in the rain What a glorious feelin' I'm happy again I'm laughin' at clouds So dark up above The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love Let the stormy clouds chase Everyone from the place Come on with the rain I've a smile on my face I'll walk down the lane With a happy refrain I'm singin' Just singin' in the rain I'm singin' in the rain Just singin' in the rain What a glorious feelin' I'm happy again I'm laughin' at clouds So dark up above The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love Let the stormy clouds chase... Ladies and gentlemen, stop that girl running up the aisle! That's the girl whose voice you heard and loved tonight! She's the real star of the picture. Kathy Selden! You are My lucky star I saw you From afar Two lovely eyes At me they were gleaming Beaming I was starstruck You're all My lucky charms I'm lucky In your arms You've opened heaven's portal Here on Earth for this poor mortal You are My lucky Star",
