There are two kinds of people in this world, winners and losers. Inside each and every one of you, at the very core of your being, is a winner waiting to be awakened and unleashed upon the world. With my 9-step \"Refuse to Lose\" program, you now have the necessary tools and the insights and the know-how to put your losing habits behind you and to go out and make your dreams come true. No hesitating. No complaining. And no excuses. I want you to go out in the world and I want you to be winners! Thank you. Thank you. I'm on my way. I don't know how long. I don't know! Richard, he has nowhere else to go. I'm not smoking. I'm not! Look, I'm at the hospital. Yeah, okay, bye. Miss Hoover? Your brother's fine. I need you to keep him away from sharp objects, knives, scissors. If you have medications, depressants in your house, keep them secure. - I'd prefer to keep him, but... - I know. The insurance. You want to see him? Hey, Frank. Sheryl. I'm so glad you're still here. Well, that makes one of us. A strong low pressure system passed across New Mexico tonight bringing with it a little moisture that will cool things off a bit. We may even see a 5 to 10 degree drop in temperatures in Albuquerque. There will be no significant accumulations of rainfall... You want to talk or no? No. Hello? Anyone? Down here. We have you with Dwayne. Dwayne, hi. Uncle Frank's here. He doesn't mind, Frank. We talked. I know, I know. But we can't have you sleeping alone. The doctor said. I'm sorry. I have to insist. You'll get along fine. He's really quiet. And here's your cot. Please, Frank. Please. Thank you. I'm gonna start dinner. You can come out when you're settled. And... just leave the door open. That's important. Dwayne, honey, there's a bucket of chicken in the car. Can you get it? And I'll make a salad. - Olive? - Yeah? - Is Grandpa with you? - Yeah. - What are you guys doing? - Rehearsing. - Okay, well, dinner in 10 minutes. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Frank's here. Oh, God! Did Stan Grossman call? Well, check the machine. Dwayne, please, come on.",

Dwayne, can you check on Frank? Tell him it's dinnertime. - Olive, dinnertime! - Coming! What? Dinner? What, you don't talk anymore? Why not? You can talk. You just choose not to. Is that Nietzsche? You don't speak because of Friedrich Nietzsche. Far out. Frank, you can sit here next to Dwayne. Here's the salad, and I'm gonna run and get Sprite for everyone. - Olive, come on, dinnertime! - Okay. So, who do you hang out with? No one? What about your family? - Frank, hey! - Richard. - Good to... see you. - Yes. Let me get Olive. - Olive? Dad? - You guys, go on and start. - Let's go! - We're coming. - Frank, some Sprite? - Yes. And I want everyone to have at least a little salad. Thanks, Sheryl. Honey. So, Sheryl, I couldn't help noticing Dwayne has stopped speaking. Yeah, he's taken a vow of silence. You've taken a vow of silence? He's gonna join the Air Force Academy, become a test pilot, and he's taken a vow of silence until he reaches that goal. You're kidding! - Hi, Uncle Frank. - Oh, hey, Olive. Wow, you're getting big! Almost like a real person. - What happened to your arms? - Olive! That's all right. I had a little accident. I'm okay. How's the routine coming, honey? - It's good. - Yeah? When are you gonna show it to us? I don't know. It's up to Grandpa. A couple of days. It still needs work. What's that, chicken? Every night it's the fucking chicken! - Holy God Almighty! - Dad! - Is it possible just once we could get... - Dad! ...something to eat for dinner around here... - ...that's not the goddamn fucking chicken? - Hey! Hey, Dad! - I'm just saying! - Dad! Christ! Whenever you want to start cooking your own food, you're more than welcome.",

So, when did you start with the vow? Been nine months, Frank. He hasn't said a word. Not one. I think it shows tremendous discipline. - Richard. - I really do! Really! I think we could learn something from Dwayne. Dwayne has a goal. He has a dream. It may not be my dream, it may not be yours... But he's pursuing it with great conviction and focus. In fact, I was thinking about the 9 steps-- Oh, for crying out loud! About the 9 steps, and how Dwayne's utilizing at least 7 of them in his personal quest to self-fulfillment. - Richard, please. - Well... I'm just saying I've come around. I think he could use our support. How did it happen? - How did what happen? - Your accident. - Honey, here. - Oh, no, it's okay. - Unless you object. - Mm-mm. No, I'm pro-honesty here. I just think, you know, it's up to you. Be my guest. Olive, Uncle Frank didn't really have an accident. What happened was he... tried to kill himself. You did?! Why?! I'm sorry. I don't think this is an appropriate conversation. Honey, let's let Uncle Frank finish his dinner, okay? Why did you wanna kill yourself? - No, don't answer the question, Frank. - Richard! - Don't answer it. - Richard! He's not gonna answer the question, Frank. - I wanted to kill myself... - Don't listen to him, honey. - ...because I was very unhappy. - He's sick. He's a sick man. - He's a sick in his head man. - Richard! I'm sorry! I don't think it's an appropriate conversation for a 7-year-old. - Well, she's gonna find out anyway. - Oh, okay! Go on, Frank. Why were you unhappy? Well, there are a lot of reasons. Mainly, though, I fell in love with someone who didn't love me back. Who? One of my grad students. I was very much in love with him. Him?! It was a boy? You fell in love with a boy? Yes, I did. Very much so. That's silly. You're right. It was silly. It was very, very silly. - There's another word for it. - Dad! - So, that's when you tried to kill yourself? - Well, no. The boy that I was in love with fell in love with another man, Larry Sugarman. - Who's Larry Sugarman? - Larry Sugarman is, perhaps, the second most highly regarded Proust scholar in the U.S.",

So, I said some things that I shouldn't have said and I did some things that I shouldn't have done, and subsequently I was fired from my job and forced to move out of my apartment and move into a motel. - And that's when you tried to... - Well, no. Actually, all of that was okay. What happened was two days ago the MacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom, awarded a genius grant to Larry Sugarman. And that's when... Decided to check out early. Yes, yes. And I failed at that as well. Olive, the important thing to understand here is that Uncle Frank gave up on himself. He made a series of foolish choices, I'm sorry, and he gave up on himself, which is something that winners never do. So, that's the story, okay? Now, everyone, just let's move on and... Is he always like this? How can you stand it? Olive, tell him about your routine while you're doing this. Okay. Little Miss Chili Pepper is a beauty contest for everyone in Albuquerque, but you have to be 6 or 7 and you have to be a girl. This is our sister. - Cindy. - Spring break. Dwayne went to see his dad in Florida for two weeks, and Olive went to Laguna to see her cousins. She made it to the top of the regionals out there. I was in second place. Well, what do you think your chances are? I think I can win, because some of the other girls, they've been doing it longer, but I practice every day. - Yeah, good luck. - Not about luck, Frank. Luck is the name losers give to their own failings. It's about wanting to win, willing yourself to win. You've got to want it badder than anybody else. I do! - Then you're gonna be a winner. - Richard! It's the truth. You know, actually, there is a message from Cindy on the machine. Something about Little Mrs. Sunshine. - Sunshine? - What? - Little Miss Sunshine? - Yeah. What?! Sheryl, it's Cindy. Remember when Olive was here last month? She was runner-up in the regional Little Miss Sunshine? Well, they just called right now and said that the girl who won had to forfeit her crown. I don't know why. Something about diet pills. But anyway... Now she has a place in the state contest in Redondo Beach! Oh, my gosh!",

        "- Who's number one? - That would be me, Rich. - Really? - Mm-hm. - So, that's when. - No. What happened was I was a bit upset. So, I said some things that I shouldn't have said and I did some things that I shouldn't have done, and subsequently I was fired from my job and forced to move out of my apartment and move into a motel. - And that's when you tried to... - Well, no. Actually, all of that was okay. What happened was two days ago the MacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom, awarded a genius grant to Larry Sugarman. And that's when... Decided to check out early. Yes, yes. And I failed at that as well. Olive, the important thing to understand here is that Uncle Frank gave up on himself. He made a series of foolish choices, I'm sorry, and he gave up on himself, which is something that winners never do. So, that's the story, okay? Now, everyone, just let's move on and... Is he always like this? How can you stand it? Olive, tell him about your routine while you're doing this. Okay. Little Miss Chili Pepper is a beauty contest for everyone in Albuquerque, but you have to be 6 or 7 and you have to be a girl. This is our sister. - Cindy. - Spring break. Dwayne went to see his dad in Florida for two weeks, and Olive went to Laguna to see her cousins. She made it to the top of the regionals out there. I was in second place. Well, what do you think your chances are? I think I can win, because some of the other girls, they've been doing it longer, but I practice every day. - Yeah, good luck. - Not about luck, Frank. Luck is the name losers give to their own failings. It's about wanting to win, willing yourself to win. You've got to want it badder than anybody else. I do! - Then you're gonna be a winner. - Richard! It's the truth. You know, actually, there is a message from Cindy on the machine. Something about Little Mrs. Sunshine. - Sunshine? - What? - Little Miss Sunshine? - Yeah. What?! Sheryl, it's Cindy. Remember when Olive was here last month? She was runner-up in the regional Little Miss Sunshine? Well, they just called right now and said that the girl who won had to forfeit her crown. I don't know why. Something about diet pills. But anyway... Now she has a place in the state contest in Redondo Beach! Oh, my gosh!"

Well, when you eat ice cream, the fat in the ice cream becomes fat in your body. - Richard, I swear to God! - It's true. - What? What's wrong? - Nothing, honey. Nothing's wrong. So, if you eat a lot of ice cream, you might become fat. And if you don't, you're gonna stay nice and skinny, sweetie. - Mom? - Olive, Richard is an idiot. I like a woman with meat on her bones. - Why's everyone so upset? - No, no one's upset, honey. I just want you to understand it's okay to be skinny, and it's okay to be fat, if that's what you wanna be. Whatever you want, it's okay. Okay, but, Olive, let me ask you this... Those women in Miss America... Are they skinny, or are they fat? Honey? Well... They're skinny, I guess. Yeah. I guess they don't eat a lot of ice cream. Okay. Coffee.

Boy, I feel sorry for anybody that doesn't want to enjoy... - ...their ice cream so early in the morning. - Boy, that looks good. You sure you don't wanna have some, Olive? Those waffles are gonna be awful lonely in there. Watch this. Wait! Stop! Don't eat it all. - All right, Olive-- - Richard! Hey, Stan! Stan, it's Richard. Again. Listen, I know you're busy, but we're just dying to hear what sort of numbers you came up with in Scottsdale. So, give me a call, please. Hey, did you get him? No, I can't get a signal out of this thing. - How long till we get there? - A long time, honey. I know. But how long? Well, we gotta do 600 miles of driving today and 200 tomorrow. - That's a lot of driving. Let's go. - Well, honey, I'll drive for a while. - No, no. I got it. - No, you're right. I gotta learn how to do this. I mean, you're doing it. How hard can it be? - Push the stick down hard. - I'm pushing hard.",

        "Yodel-lay-he-hoo, that was great! Wow! Funky-licious! - I'm going backstage. - Yeah, right. See ya. Oh, look at you! Is that your costume? Mm-hm. Okay, here. Hey, what's going on? Oh, I just came to wish Olive good luck. - How're you doing, honey? - Good. - Nervous. - Yeah. You're gonna do great. I just know it. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. What's up? I don't want her to go on. - Are you authorized to be backstage? - No. - Hey, where are the dressing rooms? - Are you allowed to be here? Just tell me where the dressing rooms are. Listen, we're not in Albuquerque anymore. - Hey, how are you feeling? - Better. Where's Olive? - There. What's up? - Mom, I don't want Olive doing this. - Oh, my God! - Look around! - This place is fucked! - He's right! Look, I don't want these people judging Olive. Fuck them! - Listen, it is too late. - No, it's not too late. You're the mom, and you're supposed to protect her. Everyone is gonna laugh at her, Mom. Please don't let her do this. Olive Hoover, 2 minutes. Look, she's not a beauty queen. She's just not. - I'm gonna tell her. - No, no, Dwayne. You listen to me. Olive is who she is. She has worked so hard. She's poured everything into this. We can't just take it away from her. We can't! I know you wanna protect her. I know, honey... but we gotta let Olive be Olive. - Olive Hoover. Are you the family? - Yeah. Okay? - Olive, it's time. You okay? - Yeah. - We gotta go now. - Hang on. Olive, look at me. If you don't wanna do this, that's okay. If you wanna sit this one out, it's totally fine by us. We're proud of you anyway. We gotta go. It's time. Ready? Let's go. Good luck, honey. Copy that. 25 is performance ready, and we're walking. As fast as we can. Is she going on? - Yeah. - She's going on. Pure fairy-tale magic. Miss Charisma Whiteman! Wasn't that a stardust fantasy? Thank you for that. You have been such a patient audience. We have one more contestant, and then we'll be crowning our winner. Please give a warm welcome to... Miss... Olive Hoover! - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'd like to dedicate this to my grandpa, who showed me these moves. Oh, that is so sweet! Is he here? Where is your grandpa right now? In the trunk of our car. Okay! Well, take it away, Olive! ♪ She's a very kinky girl ♪ ♪ The kind you don't take home to mother ♪ ♪ She will never let your spirits down ♪ ♪ Once you get her off the street ♪ ♪ She likes the boys in the band ♪ ♪ She says that I'm her all time favorite ♪ ♪ When I make my move to her room, it's the right time ♪ ♪ She's never hard to please ♪ ♪ That girl is pretty wild now ♪ ♪ The girl's a super freak ♪ You suck!"
