      "raw_text": "In the summer of 1973, a few miles outside of Austin, Texas, five youths were attacked in a grisly and gruesome fashion by an unidentified madman. The shocking murders were committed with a variety of tools, including hammers, meat hooks, and most disturbingly, a chainsaw. There's an image in my mind that'll never go away. Of the five young victims, only one survived, Sally Hardesty, who after telling her story to the police, never again spoke of the horrors she saw that day. After hearing Hardesty's account, officials released this composite picture of the killer. Everybody was terrified. He is said to have worn a mask made of human skin. However, his true identity remains a mystery. For the next hour, we'll take you on a journey into one of Texas's most famous unsolved murders. ♪ I'm from San Benito, Texas… ♪ Okay, that's $18.99, unless I can interest you in a shirt or two. Okay. There you go. Whatever happened to her? Is she still alive? She became a ranger here in Texas. She must have looked for that maniac for more than 30, 40 years. So she… she found him? He was wearing a mask. Not easy to locate someone if you don't know what they look like. Hey, sis, there you are. Yeah, right where you left me, weirdo. Hey, hey, hey. Look, look, look, look. Something for your champagne later. You know, you don't actually need a corkscrew for champagne. Come on. We've gotta beat the bus. Where y'all headed, if you don't mind me asking? Uh, Harlow? - Oh. I heard about you. - You did? Everybody has. - Y'all have a nice day now. - Thank you. Gentri-fuckers. Here. Where's Dante? Uh… Success! Found a pocket of cell signal over yonder. Mm-hmm. So, apparently, the bus took a wrong turn like 20 miles back, but we're back on track now. We're fine. We're solid. Let's get on the road. Let's go. Let's go. Look at this guy. Who has such a small dick they need to walk around in public with a fucking gun? Like, I mean, is he compensating for something? I mean… Come on, Mel. - Melody, don't. - What? I'm just saying. Excuse me, ma'am. What? See, we're plagued by feral hogs around these parts. And the only way to deal with an invasive species is to eradicate them. On sight. Okay. Okay. Let's go before she gets us all killed. Come on, girls. Let's go.",

Hey. Uh, Richter's our contractor, Mel. Gave your buildings a facelift, about all I can do in a week. It looks good for the auction. Thank you.

Yeah, that's a cult. - What? - It's all right, not judging. Just pay me. We're good. Hey guys, you should, uh… you should see this. What? - Oh… - Oh shit. What? Are you serious? - Newsflash, we're in deep Texas. - I don't care. We have a bus full of potential investors on the way. They see this flag, they're not gonna buy. - Trust me. - I'm getting the cowboy. Mel, help me. I'll just be here. Hmm… Um, I'm going upstairs. Look at this place. It's weird. Ah, shit. Damn, I couldn't reach it. - Oh shit. Well, what are we going to do? - Let's just wait for the contractor. What are you doing in our house? Uh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize... We thought this place was empty. Oh, you're the new neighbors, aren't you? Uh… Wish I'd known y'all were coming. I'd have put my face on. Sweet tea?

Ma'am, the bank, um, reclaimed this property months ago. You're not supposed to be here. You talking about that whole mix up with the bank? That's been settled. I paid everything I owed.

It's not what you think. That flag belonged to my great granddaddy. It reminds me of him. I haven't given it much thought. I… I understand your friend. I wish I could help you, but you can't be here. There are shelters for the elderly, and… Shelter? I'm not going anywhere. I told you. This is our house. Look, you'll be safer in a home and better taken care of. A woman your age shouldn't be on her own. Baby, I'm fine. I'm all right. Just go back to your room. He's the last of my boys. He needs special care. He doesn't do well outside, you understand that? It's why I can't ever leave here. Christ, Ginny, why are you still here? What have you done? Virginia, we told you weeks ago. She ain't listening. Let's get her outta here. - We'll talk about it outside. - Come on. Let's go. Take it easy. I barely touched her. Oh my God. What is happening? We need to call an ambulance. We are the ambulance. It's all right. It's her boy. Grab the oxygen. Put her in the van. She's having a heart attack. The check… It was… Please… Hey, hey, what did you do? We'll get you to the hospital in no time. Just hold on. Shit. The bus is here. Fuck. I'm going with her. No, Melody, no, no, no. I'll go with her. I'll go. What? Everyone's expecting to see the two of you. She'll be okay. Come on. - Christ. - Somebody needs to. It can't be Melody, can't be you. You need to focus on this. I'll be back as soon as I can. Okay. Please just make sure she's all right. Thank you. You're an angel. Let's move. Here's your flag. Come on, Mel. We'll get somebody to clean that up. Did that not feel like a bad omen to you? This place is cursed now. Please, this is not... I don't need this right now, so… it's all good. If you move here, I'm moving back with Dad. No, you're not. I… I don't want to live here. Your whole idea is insane. - You don't know what you want. - Okay, and you do? Uh, I know you need me, and you can't take care of yourself. Wait.",

        "- That's because you don't have it. - Dante, don't. What? Was this about my flag? You got me all wrong. I've taken care of many boys like you over the years. I don't have a problem with Negroes. Okay. Fuck this. You watch your mouth, boy. You watch yours. Where are you going? Let the cops deal with her. I don't have time for this. I'm getting the sheriff. It's not what you think. That flag belonged to my great granddaddy. It reminds me of him. I haven't given it much thought. I… I understand your friend. I wish I could help you, but you can't be here. There are shelters for the elderly, and… Shelter? I'm not going anywhere. I told you. This is our house. Look, you'll be safer in a home and better taken care of. A woman your age shouldn't be on her own. Baby, I'm fine. I'm all right. Just go back to your room. He's the last of my boys. He needs special care. He doesn't do well outside, you understand that? It's why I can't ever leave here. Christ, Ginny, why are you still here? What have you done? Virginia, we told you weeks ago. She ain't listening. Let's get her outta here. - We'll talk about it outside. - Come on. Let's go. Take it easy. I barely touched her. Oh my God. What is happening? We need to call an ambulance. We are the ambulance. It's all right. It's her boy. Grab the oxygen. Put her in the van. She's having a heart attack. The check… It was… Please… Hey, hey, what did you do? We'll get you to the hospital in no time. Just hold on. Shit. The bus is here. Fuck. I'm going with her. No, Melody, no, no, no. I'll go with her. I'll go. What? Everyone's expecting to see the two of you. She'll be okay. Come on. - Christ. - Somebody needs to. It can't be Melody, can't be you. You need to focus on this. I'll be back as soon as I can. Okay. Please just make sure she's all right. Thank you. You're an angel. Let's move. Here's your flag. Come on, Mel. We'll get somebody to clean that up. Did that not feel like a bad omen to you? This place is cursed now. Please, this is not... I don't need this right now, so… it's all good. If you move here, I'm moving back with Dad. No, you're not. I… I don't want to live here. Your whole idea is insane. - You don't know what you want. - Okay, and you do? Uh, I know you need me, and you can't take care of yourself. Wait."
