      "raw_text": "What are you gonna do today, Napoleon? Whatever I feel like I want to do. Gosh! Your current event, Napoleon. Last week, Japanese scientists explaced... placed explosive detonators at the bottom of Lake Loch Ness... to blow Nessie out of the water. Sir Curt Godfrey of the Nessie Alliance... summoned the help of Scotland's local wizards... to cast a protective spell over the lake and its local residents... and all those who seek for the peaceful existence of our underwater ally. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hey, Napoleon, what'd you do all last summer again? I told you. I spent it with my uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines. - Did you shoot any? - Yes, like 50 of 'em. They kept tryin' to attack my cousins. What the heck would you do in a situation like that? - What kind of gun did you use? - A frickin' 12-gauge. What do you think? You think you're funny? Just watch your step. But I didn't... Hey, could I use your guys's phone for a sec? - Is there anything wrong? - I don't feel very good. - Hi. - Is Grandma there? No, she's getting her hair done. - What do you need? - Can you just go get her for me? - I'm really busy right now. - Well, just tell her to come get me. - Why? - 'Cause I don't feel good. - Well, have you talked to the school nurse? - No, she doesn't know anything. - Will you just come get me? - No. Well, will you do me a favour then? - What? - Can you bring me my ChapStick? - No, Napoleon. - But my lips hurt real bad. Just borrow some from the school nurse. I know she has, like, five sticks in her drawer. I'm not gonna use hers, you sicko. See ya. Idiot! David Dempke, please come to the office. - David Dempke. - You do understand English? This isn't that complex. Look, the cafeteria's down the hall... to the right and downstairs. Hey, is that a new kid or something? Napoleon, this is Pedro. Would you mind showing him where his locker is? Sure. Come on. You know, there's, like, a butt load of gangs at this school. This one gang kept wanting me to join 'cause I'm pretty good with a bow staff. Do you ride the bus to school? No. I ride my bike. - What kind of bike do you have? - It's a Sledgehammer. Dang! You got shocks, pegs. Lucky! You ever take it off any sweet jumps? You got, like, three feet of air that time. Can I try it really quick?",

The worst day of my life. What do you think? Well, I want you to go see if Tina wants some of this. Kip hasn't done flipping anything today. Look, tonight me and your... Kip, listen! What? Tonight me and your aunt are gonna go visit some friends... and we're not gonna be back till tomorrow. We're gettin' low on steak, so I got Lyle comin' over tomorrow to take care of it. - Well, what's there to eat? - Knock it off, Napoleon. Make yourself a dang quesadilla! Fine! I'll be back tomorrow. Stay home and eat all the freakin' chips, Kip! Napoleon, don't be jealous that I've been chatting online with babes all day. Besides, we both know I'm training to become a cage fighter. Since when, Kip? You have the worst reflexes of all time. - Try and hit me, Napoleon. - What? I said come down here and see what happens if you try and hit me. Such an idiot. Let me see what your best move is. I'll go get it. Geez! Um, hello. Would you like to look like this? This is a girl. Because for a limited time only... glamour shots by Deb are 75% off. I already get my hair cut at the Cuttin' Corral. Well, maybe you'd be interested in some home-woven handicrafts. I'm Rex, founder of the Rex Kwon Do Self-Defense System. After one week with me in my dojo, you'll be prepared to defend yourself... with the strength of a grizzly... The reflexes of a puma... and the wisdom of a man. Come down today for your free trial lesson! In here we have some boondoggle key chains. A must-have for this season's fashion. I already made, like, infinity of those at Scout camp. Well, is anyone else here? I'm trying to earn money for college. Your mom goes to college. Let's bring in that... Tina, you fat lard. Come get some dinner. Tina, eat. Eat the food. Eat the food! It'd be nice if you could pull me into town. My name is Rex, and if you study with my eight-week program... you will learn a system of self-defense... that I developed over two seasons of fighting in the Octagon. It's called Rex Kwon Do! I need a volunteer. Okay, you'll do. Come up here. Bow to your sensei. Bow to your sensei! Okay. Now, I'm gonna give you one chance.",

Tina, come get some ham. What are you doing here, Uncle Rico? Your grandma took a little spill at the sand dunes today, broke her coccyx. What? Since when does she go to the dunes? Looks like there's a lot you don't know about her. - So, when's Grandma coming back? - I don't know. Not sure. You don't have to stay here with us. We're not babies. Talk to your Auntie Caroline. Well, Kip is, like, 32 years old. I don't mind if you stay. Thanks, Kip. What the flip was Grandma doin' at the sand dunes? She was on a date... with her boyfriend. Boyfriend? Hey, you guys want to see my video? So, what do you think? - It's pretty cool, I guess. - Oh. Man, I wish I could go back in time. I'd take state. This is pretty much the worst video ever made. Napoleon, like anyone can even know that. You know what, Napoleon? You can leave. You guys are retarded. Hey, check that out. So, you and Tammy still together? No. Not really. - Why is that? - Well... she's jealous. Says I'm livin' too much in '82. Well, I dumped her. What about your girlfriend? Well, things are gettin' pretty serious right now. I mean, we chat online for, like, two hours every day... so I guess you could say things are gettin' pretty serious. I'm just really tryin' to raise a few bucks right now so I can bring her around for a few days. Yep. Well, what's she look like? She's, uh... She's got sandy blonde hair. She's, uh, pretty-look... pretty good-looking face, but... I'm just gettin' really... just kinda T.O.'d... because, I mean, she hasn't even sent me a full body shot yet. Hey, you know... I got a little project... that we might be able to make a little moola with. Really? That sounds pretty good. Have you ever heard of nylon polymer? Go for it.

Napoleon, give me some of your Tots. - No, go find your own. - Come on. Give me some of your Tots. No. I'm freakin' starved. I didn't get to eat anything today. G... Gross. Freakin' idiot! Tina, come get some ham. What are you doing here, Uncle Rico? Your grandma took a little spill at the sand dunes today, broke her coccyx. What? Since when does she go to the dunes? Looks like there's a lot you don't know about her. - So, when's Grandma coming back? - I don't know. Not sure. You don't have to stay here with us. We're not babies. Talk to your Auntie Caroline. Well, Kip is, like, 32 years old. I don't mind if you stay. Thanks, Kip. What the flip was Grandma doin' at the sand dunes? She was on a date... with her boyfriend. Boyfriend? Hey, you guys want to see my video? So, what do you think? - It's pretty cool, I guess. - Oh. Man, I wish I could go back in time. I'd take state. This is pretty much the worst video ever made. Napoleon, like anyone can even know that. You know what, Napoleon? You can leave. You guys are retarded. Hey, check that out. So, you and Tammy still together? No. Not really. - Why is that? - Well... she's jealous. Says I'm livin' too much in '82. Well, I dumped her. What about your girlfriend? Well, things are gettin' pretty serious right now. I mean, we chat online for, like, two hours every day... so I guess you could say things are gettin' pretty serious. I'm just really tryin' to raise a few bucks right now so I can bring her around for a few days. Yep. Well, what's she look like? She's, uh... She's got sandy blonde hair. She's, uh, pretty-look... pretty good-looking face, but... I'm just gettin' really... just kinda T.O.'d... because, I mean, she hasn't even sent me a full body shot yet. Hey, you know... I got a little project... that we might be able to make a little moola with. Really? That sounds pretty good. Have you ever heard of nylon polymer? Go for it. Back in '82, I used to be able to throw a pigskin a quarter mile."

I can go to the dance with you. And also... I wanted to thank you for the beautiful drawing you did of me. - It's hanging in my bedroom. - Really? Took me, like, three hours to finish the shading on your upper lip. It's probably the best drawing I've ever done. Yeah, it's really... nice. Yeah, well, I'll probably pick you up at 6:00 for the dance. - Is that okay? - That's fine. Okay, bye. Bye. - Who was that? - Trisha. - Who's she? - My woman I'm takin' to the dance. - You draw her a picture? - Heck, yes, I did! Well, what are you going to wear to the dance? Just, like, a silk shirt or something. - What are you gonna wear? - Dad has something for me. But you should probably get a suit. Pedro, how do you feel about that one? It looks nice. Yeah. It looks pretty sweet. It looks awesome. That suit, it's... It's incredible. I need you to give me a ride in an hour. Where to? The dance. - You takin' my client's daughter? - Yes. We need to pick her up too. Well, Uncle Rico's got a sale to finalize in Bonita in five minutes. Can't you take me and then drop me off when you're done or whatever? Well, I'll be back in a minute. Don't disturb me while I'm in there. Well, hurry up, 'cause I gotta get Trisha. Hi. I got your 24-piece set right here. So you guys are, like, Pedro's cousins with all the sweet hookups? Simón. Is Trisha here? Who's that in my driveway? That's my ride. Do you wanna go over by my friend Pedro and dance really quick? Napoleon. When did you get here? Just a couple minutes ago. Have you guys seen Trisha anywhere? No. Oh. She probably just went to the bathroom. Are you guys having a killer time? Yes. If you can't find Trisha, I'll let you dance with Deb for a few songs. I like your sleeves. They're real big. Thank you. I made them myself. So you and Pedro are getting really serious now? No. We're just friends. Huh. How your glamour shots been going lately? Pretty good. I could do a personal portrait sometime...",

Hit it! Dang. Look, Pedro. I don't know how they do things down in Juarez... but here in Idaho we have a little something called pride. Understand? Smashing in the face of a piñata that resembles Summer Wheatly... is a disgrace to you, me and the entire Gem State. Welcome to D-Qwon's Dance Grooves. Are you ready to get your groove on? - Yes. - All right, then. Let's get started. Are you disqualified? No. They just made me take down the flyers as a penalty for the piñatas. Can you still run for president? Yes. I don't understand. He say... you're not allowed to smash piñatas that look like real people. But we do it in Mexico all the time. Your hair looked great today. Thank you. All right. See you tomorrow, Pedro. Who are you? - I'm Lafawnduh. - What are you doing here? I'm waiting for Kip. - Kip? - Why are you so sweaty? - I been practising. - Mmm. - Practising what? - Some dance moves. You like dancing? My chores are done. - So, you ready, Lafawnduh? - I am, honey. Sorry, Napoleon. We're just runnin' a little bit late for some prime rib. - Tell Uncle Rico not to wait up for me. - Here. You might like that. My cousin made it. I'll be waitin' outside for you, baby. Bye, Napoleon. See ya. Lafawnduh is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I'm a hundred percent positive that she's my soul mate. Napoleon, I'm sure there's a babe out there for you too. Peace out. See ya. Is this what you were looking for? Nah, I was thinkin' of somethin' a little more... soft around the edges. Hmm. Well... I have a nice, soft pink sheet I could hang... and I could wrap you in some foam or... something billowy? Yeah, billowy's good. It'd be really nice if I could get the fan going. I could hang some tinsel from the top. You know, Deborah, you have... striking features. Such a soft face should be complimented with a... soft body. Mr. Rico? My friends and clients, they call me Uncle Rico. What are you doing? Shh. Don't say another word. Napoleon told me you'd be interested. Napoleon? You stop wishin', and call me when you're ready. - Hello? - Napoleon? - Yeah.

I don't need herbal enhancers to feel good about myself. And if you're so concerned about that, why don't you try eating some yourself? Right on. Grandma just called and said you're supposed to go home. - She didn't tell me anything. - Too bad.

Deb just called me. She pretty much hates me by now. - Why? - 'Cause my Uncle Rico's an idiot! Do you have anything to give to her? No, not unless she likes fish. - Are you still gonna give your speech tomorrow? - Yes. - Do you already know what you're gonna say? - Yes... but not all of it.

I promise to put two new pop machines in the cafeteria, and... I'm also gonna get a glitter Bonnebell dispenser for all the girls' bathrooms. Oh, we're gonna get new cheerleading uniforms. Anyway, I think I'd be a great class president, so, uh... who wants to eat chimini-changas next year? Not me. See, with me, it will be summer all year long. Vote for Summer. And now Summer will perform her skit with members of our very own Happy Hands Club. Your speech is up next.
