      "raw_text": "MAN 1 : Are you watching closely? (CHIRPING) MAN 2 : Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts. The first part is called \"the pledge.\" The magician shows you something ordinary. A deck of cards, a bird or a man. (APPLAUSE) He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it, to see that it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But, of course, it probably isn't. Where do you think you're going? I'm part of the bloody act, you fool. (LOUD ZAPPING) The second act is called \"the turn.\" (ZAPPING) The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be... fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act. The hardest part. The part we call... ...\"the prestige.\" (MUFFLED SCREAMING) MAN : The prestige? And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer, get to that final part of his trick that night? - No, sir. Something went wrong. - What went wrong? I saw someone making their way below stage. I followed him. It was Borden, watching Mr. Angier drown. Would you please describe your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter. CUTTER : I'm an ingénieur, I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them. So, Mr. Cutter, was this water-filled tank beneath the stage part of Mr. Angier's illusion? No. The tank was brought on for the first trick and then taken offstage. Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the end of it. How large was this tank? It's a normal tank for escape under water, about 400 or 500 gallons. How do you think he was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing? - He's a magician, ask him. - (LAUGHING) MAN : I ask again, would this man explain the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion. The Real Transported Man is one of the most sought after illusions in this business. I have the right to sell it on. If I reveal the method here, the trick is worthless. How can we know that the tank wasn't simply some part of the trick that went wrong? Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament.",

I want your secret, Mr. Borden. Consider your daughter. ANGIER : A cipher, an enigma... ... a search, a search for answers. Even if Colorado is the end of my journey, it'll take much longer to unravel the rest of Borden's secrets.

(RUMBLING) (RUMBLING CONTINUES) - (ELECTRICAL ZAPPING) - (GROANS) (DOOR SLAMS) MAN : I'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers can't read my sign. Not the welcome I was expecting. I know you. You're the Great Danton. I saw your show in London. Seven times you guessed every object the audience had in their pockets. I'm Alley. Sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work. - I've come to see Tesla. - Why? He made a machine for a colleague of mine some time ago. - Can you get me a meeting with him? - Impossible, I'm afraid.

Are either of you two gentlemen sailors? - No. - No. I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot. (DRUM TAPPING CONTINUES) (STOPWATCH TICKING) (DRUM ROLL) (APPLAUSE) He's complacent, he's predictable, he's boring. Milton has gotten success, whatever that means, so now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all. He's squandering the goodwill of his audience with tired, - second-rate tricks... - They're all favorites. Give me something fresh.

No. No one else can do my trick. - Any trick can be duplicated. - Wrong. If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece, he's prepared to do it.

You two go and see that show, and whichever one of you can tell me how he does the goldfish bowl trick gets the prize. - Which is? - Ten minutes onstage with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman. - Really? - Who's Ackerman? The top theatrical agent in London. - I saw you drop the knot again. - WOMAN : I turned my wrists. Some nights you just don't get it, do you? I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break her leg. It's the wrong knot. Like I said, the Langford double will hold tighter. The Langford double isn't a wet knot. It's too dangerous. If the rope swells, she can't slip it. - I can slip a Langford underwater. - We can practice. - Borden, he said no. - Oh, you know knots better than me? Listen, no more mistakes. All right. Yeah? Do you? You want to take over? - Just leave. - I didn't think so. Hey, Cutter, where's he from? Where are you from? He shifts props for Virgil at the hall. - Worried he'll steal your tricks? - Doesn't deal in methods. - How do you know? - Because I hired him to find out how Virgil does the orange trick. - I don't trust him. - He's a natural magician. 'Course you can't trust him. I think he's all right. - You think everyone's all right. - Even you. Watch your sightlines. If I can see you kiss your wife's leg every night, so can the blokes at the ends of rows three and four! (ORIENTAL-SOUNDING GUITAR STRUMMING) (SNARE DRUM ROLL) ANGIER : You're wrong.

You two go and see that show, and whichever one of you can tell me how he does the goldfish bowl trick gets the prize. - Which is? - Ten minutes onstage with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman. - Really? - Who's Ackerman? The top theatrical agent in London. - I saw you drop the knot again. - WOMAN : I turned my wrists. Some nights you just don't get it, do you? I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break her leg. It's the wrong knot. Like I said, the Langford double will hold tighter. The Langford double isn't a wet knot. It's too dangerous. If the rope swells, she can't slip it. - I can slip a Langford underwater. - We can practice. - Borden, he said no. - Oh, you know knots better than me? Listen, no more mistakes. All right. Yeah? Do you? You want to take over? - Just leave. - I didn't think so. Hey, Cutter, where's he from? Where are you from? He shifts props for Virgil at the hall. - Worried he'll steal your tricks? - Doesn't deal in methods. - How do you know? - Because I hired him to find out how Virgil does the orange trick. - I don't trust him. - He's a natural magician. 'Course you can't trust him. I think he's all right. - You think everyone's all right. - Even you. Watch your sightlines. If I can see you kiss your wife's leg every night, so can the blokes at the ends of rows three and four!   ANGIER : You're wrong. It can't be. - Look at the man. - This is the trick. This is the performance. Right here. This is why no one can detect his method."

Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign against Mr. Tesla's superior alternating current. MAN : We have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider. MAN 2 : Which he will not! But I've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions. - (GASPS) - This thing's gonna blow. Ladies and gentlemen, please. BORDEN : Hey. Hello, Jess. Have you had a nice day with mommy?

That's a lovely name. That's a lovely name. Well, you talk about what you want to do for the rest of the day. All right, go on, you talk with her. Are they taking her away? To the workhouse? You keep talking. Tell Owens I've reconsidered. Take it. Go on, take it. It's for the best. Let me see. I'm gonna learn all the professor's secrets. Only if I teach you how to read. They're just stupid tricks, right? Haven't helped you get out of here, have they? Or can't you undo real locks, professor? Maybe I'm just biding my time. Maybe one day I'll... ...open my hand, get your attention, ask, \"Are you watching closely?\" Maybe a magic whirl or two. And then I'll be gone. How'd you get so famous then? Magic. - Oi! Borden, get back here! - (ALL LAUGING) Thank you. Shut up! (LAUGHING CONTINUES) Where's the bloody key?! (DISTANT ELECTRICAL HUMMING) ANGIER : February 8, 1899. Today, finally, a breakthrough.

The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it. At least he saw it. I spent the ovation hiding under the stage. No one cares about the man who disappears. They care about the one who comes out. I care about the man in the box. Thank you. I don't know, maybe we could switch before the trick. I'm the prestige, and Root's below stage. No, the anticipation of the trick is everything. We need your showmanship to build up the suspense. Once Root opens his mouth, it's over. He can't introduce this trick. Of course I can."

To give your show what it's missing. - Yeah, what might that be? - Me. (CHUCKLES) I was just saying that, wasn't I? - A woman's touch. - I've left Angier. - All right. - I want a job. Yeah. I know you've no reason to trust me. Why wouldn't I trust you? You're only the mistress of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you? - Mr. Borden - Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth. Now that is a slippery notion in our line of work, isn't it, Miss Wenscombe? I am here because he sent me here. He wants me to work for you and steal your secret. What does he need my secret for? His trick is topnotch. He vanishes, and then he reappears instantly on the other side of the stage, mute, overweight and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk. It's astonishing. How does he do it?

Which makes it so much harder when you don't. More shopping. She does love the smell of money. The little lady wants to go to the zoo, so I thought you could take her, yeah? I mean, I can do it tomorrow, if not. And, uh... Sarah, she knows. Uh, at least she knows that something is not right, so if you can just do whatever you can to help me. Talk to her, just convince her that I do love her. What is it, Freddie? Listen, don't call me that, please. It's nothing. It's just that sometimes it seems wrong. I told you, when you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong. I'm trying. I'm trying, Olivia. - I'll get dressed. - Yeah. I saw Fallon hanging around again. There's something about that man I don't trust. You trust me? Then trust Fallon. He protects the things that I care about. (ENGINE SPUTTERS) We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier. We were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave, as well. He's very good to Colorado Springs. Mr. Angier, I didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box. What box? TESLA : I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye. But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado. The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry. Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field, where people are happy to be mystified. You will find what you are looking for in this box. Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions.

        "Sarah, whatever you may think... ...your only competition for my affections is our little girl. I love you. I will always love you and you alone. - You mean it today. - Absolutely. Which makes it so much harder when you don't. More shopping. She does love the smell of money. The little lady wants to go to the zoo, so I thought you could take her, yeah? I mean, I can do it tomorrow, if not. And, uh... Sarah, she knows. Uh, at least she knows that something is not right, so if you can just do whatever you can to help me. Talk to her, just convince her that I do love her. What is it, Freddie? Listen, don't call me that, please. It's nothing. It's just that sometimes it seems wrong. I told you, when you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong. I'm trying. I'm trying, Olivia. - I'll get dressed. - Yeah. I saw Fallon hanging around again. There's something about that man I don't trust. You trust me? Then trust Fallon. He protects the things that I care about.  We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier. We were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave, as well. He's very good to Colorado Springs. Mr. Angier, I didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box. What box? TESLA : I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye. But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado. The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry. Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field, where people are happy to be mystified. You will find what you are looking for in this box. Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions. I add only one suggestion on using the machine. Destroy it. Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean. Such a thing will bring you only misery. ANGIER : Tesla's warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be. Today I tested the machine. Taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation.

Fallon's missed you too. We both have. Daddy, can I come in there? Not right now. Not right now, darling. No, but everything is gonna be all right. You must be Lord Caldlow? Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been. They flatter you with all those chains. Don't they know you can't escape without your rubber ball? I pulled you out... out of that tank. All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician. But you couldn't leave me alone. I don't know what you've done. But you're not afraid to get your hands dirty anymore, are you? No, not anymore. And I win. No one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears. You win? This ain't a bloody competition anymore. This is my little girl's life. And don't you dare put her in the middle of this. Oh, I know how hard it is to have someone so special taken away from you, don't I, Borden? And you can't take it with you, now, can you? Oh, she'll be looked after. Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling. No, no, no, no, stop, my darling. Look, here. That's what you're after. That's what this is about. Take it. - Your secret? - Yeah. You always were the better magician. We both know that. Whatever your secret was, you have to agree, mine is better. Don't do this. Don't do this, Angier. Jess, Jess! Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise. - For God's sake. - I promise. Look! I promise. I love you, Jess. I love you. - Come on. - I love you. I love you, Jess. Angier! Angier! What, do you think this place can hold me? Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me! And you can put a stop to this now! Listen! Listen! That man... Listen, that man is the one I'm in for killing! Listen! If he's alive, I'm not guilty! - I'm not guilty! - I don't care! - Get hold of him. - Angier! Run along now. Sir, there's a gentleman waiting. - Dear God. - Hello, Cutter. You're still alive. How is it you're still alive? I saw you on a slab, for God's sake. - Child. - Good night, sir. ANGIER : Good night, Jess. I've seen her before. I saw her in court with... ...Fallon. - What have you done? - She needs looking after. She needs her father. You're letting him hang, and I helped you.",
