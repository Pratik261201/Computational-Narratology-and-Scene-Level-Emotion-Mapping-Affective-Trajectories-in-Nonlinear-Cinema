      "raw_text": "Brother... Mother... It was they who led me to your door. A man's heart has heard two ways through life. The way of nature. And the way of grace. You have to choose which one you'll follow. Grace doesn't try to please itself. It accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked... It accepts insults and injuries. Nature only wants to please itself. Bless our lord this food... Get others to please it too. ...Loving and faithful service... It likes to lord it over them. ...Bless these boys... To have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy. When all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things. They taught us, that no one who loves the way of grace, ever comes to a bad end. I will be true to you. Whatever comes... My son. I just want to die. To be with him. He's in God's hands now. He was in God's hands the whole time. Wasn't he? My home. My God. I shall fear no evil. Fear no evil, for you are with me. What did you gain? Be not far from me, for trouble is near. Go on now, we're alright. We're alright. Thank you. Shouldn't have your memories of him, ... You have to be strong now, and... I know, the pain will, it will pass in time. You know, it might seem, hard, my saying that, but it's true. I don't want it to. Life goes on. People pass along. Nothing stays the same. You still got the other two. The Lord gives and the Lord takes away. That's the way he is. He sends flies to wounds...that he should heal. I never got a chance to tell him how sorry I was. I even... ...punched himself in the face for no reason. You sit next to me at the piano and I criticized where he'd turned the pages. I might even feel ashamed. Why shame? Poor boy. Poor boy. How did you come to me? In what shape? What disguise? I see the child I was. I see my brother. True. Kind. He died when he was 19. Just check, this one against this. She wants to get back together. But, the chapter's closed, the story's been told. What are you gonna do? Experiment. When you're young, it's all about your career. I just feel like I'm...bumping into walls... The world's gone to the dogs, people are greedy and keep getting worse. I try to get into their hands. Hey dad, I'm sorry I said what I said, I'm... Yea, I think about him every day. I just shouldn't have said what I did, I'm sorry.",

Help me be thankful for everything I've got. Where do you live? Help me not to tell lies. Are you watching me? I want to know what you are. I want to see what you see. Come here. You're going to stand there and you're going to close this door quietly, 50 times. Count it out. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 You can't just take off the top. You got to get them by the roots. Your mother's naive. It takes fierce will to get ahead in this world. If you're good, people take advantage of you. Every one of these top executives, you know how they got where they are? Floated right down the middle of the river. Don't let anyone tell you there's anything you can't do. Don't do like I did, promise me that. Dreamed of being a great musician. I let myself get sidetracked. If you're looking for something to happen, that was it. Life, lived it. Job imagined he might build his nest on high. That the integrity of his behavior would protect him against misfortune. And his friends thought mistakenly That the Lord could only have punished him because secretly he had done something wrong. But no. Misfortune befalls the good as well. We can't protect ourselves against it. We can't protect our children. We can't say to ourselves, even if I'm not happy, I'm going to make sure they are. We run before the wind, we think that it will carry us forever. It will not. We vanish as a cloud, we whither as the autumn grass. And like a tree, are rooted up. Is there some fraud in the scheme of the universe? Is there nothing which is deathless? Nothing, which does not pass away? We cannot stay where we are. We must journey forth. We must find that which is greater than fortune or fate. Nothing can bring us peace, but that. Is the body of the wise man or the just, exempt from any pain? From any disquietude, from the deformity that might blight its beauty from the weakness, that might destroy its health. Do you trust in God? Job too, was close to the Lord. Are your friends and children, your security? There is no hiding place in all the world where trouble may not find you. No one knows when sorrow might visit his house, any more than Job did.",

You want to succeed? You can't be too good. Hey there young fella, try my cornbread. Do y'all want some butter, do you? How about a pound of bread. You'll like this right? Okay? Come on. Act like you're in trouble, you don't want to fight, you don't want any trouble. The minute you see him blink, crack him! Okay? Okay, come on, three quarters. Cover, you're going to cover, right? Okay, here. Come on, nice, harder, nice. That's a good right, let's see your left. This is the most important thing. Okay? You come in this way, keep your gaurd up. Hit me, come on, hit me. Come on, Jack? Hit me. Hit me, come on, come on! Okay, here it is, hit me! Come on, son, come on! What are you doing? Wipe yourself off. Left! Don't leave your tongue out, you're going to lose it! Left. Left. Right. Right. Left harder. Harder. Harder! Hit me, hit me. Come on son, hit. Give me something, show me what you got. Come on, go on. One meal. Leave the table. You too? You going to continue to defy me? No, sir. You're interrupting me, I wasn't done yet. Am I finished? No? Yea Thank you, your majesty. Makes up stories. Fortunate words. He says don't put your elbows on the table. He does. Insults people. Doesn't care. I remember when you were born. They wouldn't let me come home. Navy said an officer must be present for the laying of the cue. I had to launch. The next word is volcano. Next word is socket. Please pass your answers to each other. We're going to grade each others' papers now. No interruptions, please. Come on, get your pencil out. Sweetheart!, Oh God, sweetheart!"
