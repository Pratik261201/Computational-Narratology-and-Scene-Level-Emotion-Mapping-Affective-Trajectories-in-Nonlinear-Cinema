Sadie, wake up! Oh, my gosh! Daddy, wake up! Okay, I'm up. Is that my genius over here? Is that my genius? I need you to take the kids to school this morning. - I would, but I'm supposed to work out. - What? Yeah. I got an appointment with a trainer. I can't cancel it now. He'll charge me. - You didn't tell me that. - Yeah, I did. - Last week I told you. - You didn't tell me. I did. And then I wrote it on the calendar like you told me to. No, you didn't tell me. - I did tell you. - Well, you didn't, but what are we gonna do, 'cause I have an appointment? So you're taking the kids to school. Don't use the baby to cover your tracks. I can drive them. I'll drive them to school. - Thank you very much. - Great. Good. You turned my sister into a limo driver. - I don't mind. - It all worked out! What are you giggling about? Be quiet. You're starting to annoy me. - Poo poo. - Ladies. Be nice. - You know what I did the other day? - What? - I googled \"murder.\" - You googled \"murder\"? - Yeah. - Why? I mean, what did it say? It didn't say anything. It just showed pictures of people lying dead on the floor and blood everywhere, and... That was just ketchup. - Who wants to hear some music? - I want to hear Rent. I want to hear Green Day! No, we're listening to Rent! Well, I want to listen to Green Day. I got your baby! - Don't taunt her. Come on. - Here. Sadie! Why did you just do that? Don't throw things at your sister! She hit me. - Did you hit her? - I did not. Make her happy. It's okay. - It won't make her happy. - It's okay. It's okay. She spilled all the marbles on the floor. Well, give her her marble back. All right? Are you sure you understand the terms of the bet? - Because this is serious. - No. Martin, all right, listen. You don't shave your beard or cut your hair for one year, and if you can do that, I will pay your rent. But if you shave, then you have to pay all five of our rents. Thanks for the free money, bitch. Hey, Martin, was it weird when you joined the Taliban, being American and everything like that? Like when you see a woman driving a car, do you just get pissed? Just watch your back, Serpico.",

Okay, let me know when she's pulling in. - She's about to pull in. - Is she camera-ready? Is she camera-ready? If she's gonna be in hair and makeup for three hours, I can't do it. I'm not gonna be here. I got to do American Idol. It's live. I got to do it. I got to be there. - What are we gonna interview her about? - Nothing personal. - No personal questions. - No personal questions. Don't ask her about her sister and her nose job. - No plastic surgery questions. - No plastic... No personal questions.

Just remember, you've got it here, you've got it here and everybody's gonna see you right there. Yay! That's so exciting! Oh, my God! Hey! Huh? I got a promotion. - Oh, congratulations! - Thank you. Hey, maybe you can get your own place now. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. - Yay! - Let's go celebrate. Okay. Let's do it. - Pete'll watch the kids? - Yeah! We can watch Taxicab Confessions. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know! I'm so excited! I walked in on him masturbating one night. Did he get the deer-in-the-headlights look? Did he freeze or did he finish? No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't doing anything under the covers. Oh, no! I buy these nice towels, and he whacks off into them. - Deb and Pete, forever. - And... And once he does that into them once, they're never soft ever again. I can always tell if I'm looking good based on whether or not we get in. - Ladies? - Guess we're looking good. - If I didn't get in, I would've lost my shit. - What's going on, man? How long you gonna make us wait out here, for Christ's sake? What the fuck? You know what movie I just saw again the other day, which is fucking, like, mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it since it came out is Munich. Oh, Munich! - Oh, man, Munich fucking rules. - Munich is awesome! That movie was Eric Bana kicking fucking ass! Dude, every movie with Jews, we're the ones getting killed. Munich flips it on its ear. We're capping motherfuckers. Not only killing but fucking, like, taking names. If any of us get laid tonight, it's because of Eric Bana in Munich. I agree with that. I agree. You know what is not helping us get laid is the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, over here at our table. - I don't like your shoes. - How was Burning Man this year? Fuck you guys. I'm glad I'm not Jewish. - So are we. - Yeah, so are we. Yeah. Fine, screw it. - You weren't chosen for a reason. - Yeah.

We would just like it if you go home and step on the scale and write down how much you weigh and subtract it by, like, 20. - Twenty. - And then weigh that much. Just remember, you've got it here, you've got it here and everybody's gonna see you right there. Yay! That's so exciting! Oh, my God! Hey! Huh? I got a promotion. - Oh, congratulations! - Thank you. Hey, maybe you can get your own place now. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. - Yay! - Let's go celebrate. Okay. Let's do it. - Pete'll watch the kids? - Yeah! We can watch Taxicab Confessions. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know! I'm so excited! I walked in on him masturbating one night. Did he get the deer-in-the-headlights look? Did he freeze or did he finish? No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't doing anything under the covers. Oh, no! I buy these nice towels, and he whacks off into them. - Deb and Pete, forever. - And... And once he does that into them once, they're never soft ever again. I can always tell if I'm looking good based on whether or not we get in. - Ladies? - Guess we're looking good. - If I didn't get in, I would've lost my shit. - What's going on, man? How long you gonna make us wait out here, for Christ's sake? What the fuck? You know what movie I just saw again the other day, which is fucking, like, mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it since it came out is Munich. Oh, Munich! - Oh, man, Munich fucking rules. - Munich is awesome! That movie was Eric Bana kicking fucking ass! Dude, every movie with Jews, we're the ones getting killed. Munich flips it on its ear. We're capping motherfuckers. Not only killing but fucking, like, taking names. If any of us get laid tonight, it's because of Eric Bana in Munich. I agree with that. I agree. You know what is not helping us get laid is the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, over here at our table. - I don't like your shoes. - How was Burning Man this year? Fuck you guys. I'm glad I'm not Jewish. - So are we. - Yeah, so are we. Yeah. Fine, screw it. - You weren't chosen for a reason. - Yeah. It's like everyone in here is 12 years old. - Am I too old to be here? - What? - Am I too old to be here? - No, of course not. Does it look weird that I'm here? No, not at all."

Jonah broke his elbow once. He just got high, and it still clicks, but, I mean, he's okay. - Right. - Yeah. Last night was great, what I remember of it. Right, yeah. Yeah, no, it was fun.

I was out celebrating it. - No? - No. I don't remember that at all. Yeah. I'm super excited about it.

Like who gives a shit? Well, I hope a lot of people, actually, because that's what my job entails is making sure people care what he has to say. I'm interviewing him. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I just don't give a shit. I'm just saying he deserves a beat-down. Actually, it's sort of embarrassing to ask at this point, but what do you do for work? Me and my roommates have started a... We're starting an Internet website. Oh, cool. What is it? I'll give you the virtual experience, okay?"

Sorry it took so long to get a table. I didn't realize you needed a reservation. Oh, no, that's okay. - So how's work? - Great. - How's E!? - Great. That's awesome.

We don't technically get money for the hours we put in, but it is our job. - So, how do you... Right. - How do I pay rent and shit? When I was in high school, I got ran over by a postal truck. - Oh, my God. - It just kind of... It was my foot more than anything. But I got like 14 grand from the British Columbia government. - Right. - And that really lasted me. I mean, until now. It's been almost 10 years. I have like 900 bucks left.",

Just in the evenings and all day every weekend. Not that much. Honestly, though, when you look at me do you not think at all, like, \"You know, if he just never existed, I would have avoided a massive heap of trouble,\" you know? Absolutely not.

You know, we got ourselves into this situation. We kind of have to. - For the baby, right? - Exactly. Okay, if this was our second date, what would you do? B.J., if I'm just being honest, I would probably... I told my roommates I thought I was gonna get a B.J., so... You know what? For the sake of getting to know one another, can you not talk like that? Yeah, I can do that. I'm... I'm really nervous. I'm nervous, too. I'm really nervous. Yeah. You're a sweet guy, right? I think I am. Yeah. Don't fuck me over, okay? I wouldn't do that. Just so you know, I'm the guy girls fuck over. I'm that guy. So you don't fuck me over. - Okay? - Okay. I couldn't take it. I can't raise this baby alone. Who's he? I'm Ben Stone. He's my boyfriend. That's nice. I've never met him before. Well, he's a new boyfriend. But a boyfriend. So he came over for breakfast because he's your new boyfriend? Yeah. He came from his house. Drove over to our house because he thought it would be fun to have breakfast with us, so he drove his car from his house to our house to have breakfast. Because he likes breakfast so much. I love breakfast. You guys wanna hear something neat? We're gonna have a baby together. - What? - Yeah, a baby. Well, you're not married. Aren't you supposed to be married to have a baby? You don't have to be. But they should be because they love each other, and people who love each other get married and have babies. Mmm-mmm. Do you love each other? Yes, they love each other. Because that's what you do. When you love each other, you get married and have a baby. Where do babies come from? Where do you think they come from? Well, I think a stork, he drops it down, and then a hole goes in your body, and there's blood everywhere, coming out of your head, and then you push your belly button, and then your butt falls off, and then you hold your butt and you have to dig, and you'll find a little baby.",

Great job. - Thanks. - You're pregnant, aren't you? - What? I mean, you've put on like, eight pounds, nine. It's all in your uterus. Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you think they're gonna be mad?

Just tell them. They'll be cool. Everybody loves somebody pregnant. Did you see this sex offender website? These are all the sex offenders in our neighborhood. Looks like your computer has chicken pox. Those are sex offenders. These people live in our neighborhood. Well, I'll skip their houses when we're trick-or-treating. What do you want me to do? Form a posse? Got your six-shooter on you? I got my lynching rope. You shouldn't take it so lightly. I don't take it lightly. You know, I'm not gonna go over to any of these people's houses and say, \"Hey, do you mind... Can you baby-sit?\" If I didn't care about these things, you wouldn't care about anything. Care more. You're so concerned with stuff, like \"Don't get them vaccinated.\" Don't let them eat fish. There's mercury in the water.\" Jesus, how much Dateline NBC can you watch?

        "Credit bush. - You never get opening credit bush. - I know. That's so crazy. No. You got me. How many doctors are there in your practice? Just 'cause I'm sort of looking for a more personal experience. I wanna make sure that you're my doctor on the day, and... Yeah, I understand. We have three other doctors in the practice, but I'm your man, okay? I don't take vacations. I hate Hawaii. I went to the Caribbean when I was 14, and I'm never going back. I feel really good about this. I think we found our doctor. - Really? - Yeah. All right. - Are you serious right now? - Yeah. Wow. - You look relieved. - I am very relieved. I can't imagine meeting any more of you people. You're being dramatic. We didn't meet that many. Do they know? Pardon? The belly. Oh, yeah. The donuts, they call to me. - Hey, Allison. Great job. - Thanks. - You're pregnant, aren't you? - What? I mean, you've put on like, eight pounds, nine. It's all in your uterus. Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you think they're gonna be mad? I'm, like, really chickening out about this. It's okay. We can hide this. We'll dress you in black, and we'll emphasize your boobs. Awesome. I mean, your boobs are gonna be big. And then they're gonna be, like, scary big. But then they'll go down. And then they'll stay down. Just... Just don't say anything, okay? Please don't say anything. Oh, no, I won't, I won't. Just tell them. They'll be cool. Everybody loves somebody pregnant. Did you see this sex offender website? These are all the sex offenders in our neighborhood. Looks like your computer has chicken pox. Those are sex offenders. These people live in our neighborhood. Well, I'll skip their houses when we're trick-or-treating. What do you want me to do? Form a posse? Got your six-shooter on you? I got my lynching rope. You shouldn't take it so lightly. I don't take it lightly. You know, I'm not gonna go over to any of these people's houses and say, \"Hey, do you mind... Can you baby-sit?\" If I didn't care about these things, you wouldn't care about anything. Care more. You're so concerned with stuff, like \"Don't get them vaccinated.\" Don't let them eat fish. There's mercury in the water.\" Jesus, how much Dateline NBC can you watch? I know we're supposed to be nice with each other right now, but I'm having a really hard time."

And then in the end, they thank you for it. You can't commit to him. You can't make a commitment to him. You don't even know him. I don't even know Pete after 10 years. - What? - I don't know what he's up to. He's miserable. Why do you say that? - I think he's cheating on me. - What?"

It's a big mess, but there's only like $50 worth of shit here. And that's kind of the good thing. You know, my dad told me, \"Don't move to Northridge.\" But you figure, like, what are the chances of that happening twice, you know? What is this? It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place doesn't get condemned. That would suck. - Hello? - Hey, it's me. - You! - Hi. So, listen. Will you do me a big favor? Debbie wants us to come over and have dinner tonight. She thinks Pete is cheating on her. - Really? - Yeah. Well, she saw one of his emails and... - Oh, man. - There's an address. That sounds terrible. I don't want to do that. Ben, come on. He's not cheating on her. - How do you know? - I just know. - Are you sure? - I'm 100 % sure he's not cheating. Are you really? No. It actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat. Why? 'Cause Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome. Why don't you just come over then, and we'll just diffuse the situation a little. I'm just saying the music industry is different now. You can't... Steely Dan would never even have a chance. Well, maybe it's 'cause Steely Dan gargles my balls. - They're incredible. - They really aren't good, man. Old Steely Dan. If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP. Oh, I should get going. I'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood. Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon, so I'll call you 'cause the reception's terrible over there, so... Okay. And I don't want you to worry 'cause I know you worry. I'm just gonna jump in the shower. It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band. Okay. Have fun. All right. You guys are crazy. He's acting totally normal and hilarious. She doesn't have a gun, does she? No. I don't think so. Looks like no one's home. Why was the door unlocked? Wait here. I kind of feel bad for Pete. What? This isn't a good way, you know. If you're gonna get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this. Well, maybe he should've thought of that before he was cheating.",

Why didn't you ask me to go? Because I needed to get away, you know. With work and you and the kids, sometimes I just need some time to myself. I need time for myself. I want time for myself, too.

Your baby wants you to gain a whole mess of weight. Are you fucking kidding me? Why don't you take off your earrings, too? They weigh about 80 pounds. They're made out of moon rocks, aren't they? Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am hormonal. I am terrified, and I am falling apart, so stop treating everything like it's a big joke! Okay, I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I just walked three fucking miles through Koreatown to get here! Sorry if I'm trying to lighten the mood a little. Well, don't, okay? You can't take anything seriously! You know, you didn't even read the baby books. I didn't read the baby book! What's gonna happen? How did anyone ever give birth without a baby book? That's right.

It just shows your lack of commitment, Ben! That you're not in this with me! Did you just say \"my lack of commitment\"? 'Cause that's what it sounded like. It almost seems as though you forgot I proposed to you, like an asshole! And you said no to me! If you feel that way, you should just go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't mean to do this together, okay? And... And we tried to make it work and that was good, I suppose. But it doesn't work. Because we are two completely different people. And I think it would just be easier for both of us if we stop fooling ourselves. You know, I know this isn't you talking, it's your hormones, but I would just like to say, fuck you, hormones! You are a crazy bitch, hormones. Not Allison! Hormones! Fuck them! It's a girl! Buy some pink shit! Nice. You are such an asshole. You know what? Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck! I will fuck my bong. Doggie style, for once. Are you ready? I'm really sorry about all that. That was really inappropriate. Oh, no, that's okay. It happens all the time here. It's fine.",

So, fuck you, you fucking fag with your fucking little faggy gloves. I know. You're right. I'm so sorry. I fucking hate this job. I don't want to be the one to pass judgment and decide who gets in. This shit makes me sick to my stomach. I get the runs from the stress. It's not 'cause you're not hot. I would love to tap that ass. I would tear that ass up. I can't let you in 'cause you're old as fuck, for this club, not, you know, for the Earth. What? You old. She pregnant. Can't have a bunch of old, pregnant bitches running around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed to let in 5% black people. He said that. 5%. That mean if there's 25 people here, I get to let in one-and-a-quarter black people. So I got to hope there's a black midget in the crowd. Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry. Why y'all wanna be in here anyway? Y'all need to be at a yoga class or something. What the fuck is she doing at the club? That's not even good parenting right there. Your old ass should know better than that. Oh, God. Have the mushrooms kicked in yet? This was a great idea, man. This is the best idea I've ever had in my life. What are they gonna do? What in the world are they doing? If I shaved my stomach and my chest, I would look exactly like that. Those guys are at work right now. \"What'd you do today? I just lifted my brother.\" No. Don't applaud. He'll fall. I'm freaking out right now, man. The mushrooms are turning on me. Papa. I'm not your papa! Papa! I can't deal with this shit, man! Hold up. Hold up. Ben, wait. Ben, Ben, Ben, wait! It's over. What's over? My youth. Oh, don't say that. It's true. - I just wanna dance. I love dancing. - So dance. I can't dance. I'm embarrassed. I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking whale, and I'm trying to get into some stupid club and... No, you look beautiful. And you're young and you're tall, and you got the good lips and boobs, and you're young still. I'm gonna be alone. Debbie, no, you're not. Yes, I am. Oh, God! Fucking men! I get worse-looking and he gets better-looking, and it's so fucking unfair. Oh, fuck. We should go. My babysitter always gets mad when we come home past 12:00."

So, I have to get going in. They're calling me. Steve, hey. Help me out. Give me an interview, please. Well, I just need to run in. You know what? Just say into the camera, \"You're watching E! Entertainment.\" - Congratulations. - Just give me that. No, Steve, don't be an asshole! Come on. I'm not being an asshole."

I think he'll be more cool now. I'm so sorry I broke up with you. You really don't need to be. And, you know, I knew you'd give me another shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner than this, you know?

I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere. - Screw Legoland. - All right. Hey, how do you want this? You want this over the shoulder? You know, I can do whatever you want. I can get in there. Kind of Spike Lee angles. No, you can shoot the waiting room. That would be great. Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you. I've got it from here. Debbie. Can I talk to you in the hall for a second? Why? I'd like to be in there with Allison, without you. Okay. I understand how you feel but this isn't up to you. Look, Debbie, you are high off your ass if you think you're coming into that room. If you take one step towards that door, I will tell security there's a crazy chick in a pink dress snatching up babies. Okay? So don't even try to come into that room. That's my room now.
