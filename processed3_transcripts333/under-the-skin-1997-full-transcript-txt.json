      "raw_text": "When I was small, my mother was everything to me. I thought she was beautiful and I wanted to be like her. I used to try and smile, walk, and talk just like her. I even practiced laughing like she did. My mother loved flowers and her favorite flowers were roses. And so she called my sister Rose. And she called me... Iris. Look at that, it's lovely! I'm fat, aren't I? No! It's natural. I know I am! - Haven't seen my feet in weeks. - What's this? I don't know. It's a Cocker Spaniel on a motorbike. Alright, what about this one? - My back aches all the time. - I dunno, I give up. - A vicious circle. - Mother, I'm fed up with it. Every time I get up and walk around I think I'm gonna bump into something. I can't stop weeing. My fingers are like sausages. I've got another two months! I just wanna drop it. Frank's got me this cream from France for stretch marks. - He rubs it all over me... - Do you have to? Guess how much he paid for it. Rose thinks she's so perfect. Her and Mom are so close. They're always together, always telling each other everything. - Iris... - What? Come over here. Why don't you, come on. Sit here, love, next to me. Not now, I'm busy. Where are you going? Stay with me. Stay. I've been thinking... - D'you think I should have a go at singing? - Singing? - You're not listening to me. - I am! No, no... seriously. No, I'm really serious. I want to talk to you. Please, Gary. What about? What about? We never talk. We talk all the time. My friend Vron says that when women are thinking \"I love him\", men think: \"I wonder what my dick will feel like in her mouth?\" I asked her how she knew. She said they told her. I said, 'They never tell me that'. She said you have to go behind enemy lines. So how's it going with Gary then? - All right. - Yeah? Yeah. - Why? - Just asking. - How long have you been together now? - Two years. Really? Two years? God, it's gone fast, isn't it? I love him, but... I sometimes wonder what it'd be like with someone else. - Slut. - No, no... Why? What about you? How many men have you slept with... to date? Two. - You liar! - I have! Honestly, I have. Two. Apart from one. I don't count him. - Why? - Cause it was just a quick fuck. I just felt horrible. One day, Mom felt dizzy and she fell over. We took her to hospital. They gave her a brain scan and then they told her she got a tumor.",

Iris, don't be childish. Give me back my ring! Give it back! - What is it? - It's moving! You're not having it, are you? No. No, it's over, I'm fine now. Mom didn't want to believe what the doctor had told us. Nor did Rose. All I kept thinking was, 'Three weeks, or three months...' Three weeks or three months... - Mom, what are you doing? - Rose? No, it's me, Iris. - Where is Rose? - I'm here! I was worried. It's scratching there. - There. - Thank you. I spoke to the doctor. He said you've got to have the chemo again, you're on it next week. - No. - Why not? Cause I don't want to. - You've got to. - I said no. Mom, I got you a present. - It's a healing crystal. - That's lovely, darling. Sandra's mom had cancer, it went to her brain, just like you, she had chemo... And she's dead. - You've got to think positive. - I'm finished, Rose. - I can't have the baby without you! You'll be fine, love. - You're well, you've got Frank... - What about acupuncture? Or Shiatsu... I've read these books... You can't cure cancer with acupuncture, Iris. She thinks she knows everything. - The body renews itself every 28 days. - Don't be silly. - Have you read my books? - No, I don't want to read them. - You're not gonna, are you? - I don't want to! - Where's Dad? - In Australia. Australia?! - He left, moved there ten years ago. I remember... I'll be the man. I'll lead. Help me up. Two men took her body away. Rose and I walked through the rooms deciding who was having what. Rose knew exactly what she wanted but I didn't. I took the mahogany dining room table. Except I didn't have anywhere to put it... No. I don't like this one. This manager in the shop where I worked, she said she was sorry about my mom. She didn't like her mother. She said her mother had ruined her childhood, and now, her mother made her go everywhere with her. - No, this is too small. - This manager, she didn't like me. She gave me these funny looks. I don't know why. She was always behind me. As if she expected me to do something wrong.",

Your drink was about to fall. Thanks. Oh, fuck! - You all right? - Yeah. Do you want to talk to me? - What's your name? - Tom. I'm Rose. - Nice name. - What's nice about it? Don't know. I like roses. So did my mother. They were her favorite flowers. She's dead. Sorry to hear about that. - I don?t know why I talked to him. Maybe it was his eyes, or his mouth, or the sound of his voice, or the way he moved. I wanted to talk to him. I wanted to kiss him. And so I did. - You want me to fuck you? - Yeah. I slide my thigh between his legs. He lifts up my skirt. He strokes the inside of my thigh. He kisses me everywhere: He kisses my breasts... ...my stomach... He takes my nipple in his mouth and sucks it. He bites it hard. He stands behind me, holding my hips, grinds against me, his hand between my legs, parting me. He slips it inside me, pushing it all the way, deep inside me. - I can't breathe. - What? I feel like I'm suffocating. Come back here. What's the matter? What's wrong? I need space. I mean it, Gary. I do, I'm serious. - Look... - I'm gonna have to move out. - Look, you're just depressed. - Depressed? It's only natural... You've had a difficult day. You think it's because of my mother, don't you? It's got nothing to do with my mother! It's got nothing to do with her! I'm sick. - Hello? - Hello, it's me. - Where did you get my number? - You gave it to me. - Just wanted to make sure you're okay. - I'm bloody brilliant, thank you. By the way, what did you do with Mom's ashes? - Iris? - Yeah, I've got them. - What about the ring? - What ring? You know, Mom's ring, the one she always wore. I was thinking that... I don't know, if... If you don't want it, maybe we could... we could take turns wearing it, or... Rose? I just miss Mom. Can't believe she's dead. Keep forgetting, I keep wanting to ring her, and then... I remember she's gone and I'll never see her again. Iris? Iris... Yes, can I help you? - Hi, Silvia. - Iris! You look so... different. I didn't recognize you. The party of ten we confirmed the Bahamas on the 24th, can I leave it with you? - Room for me, is there? - It's 2,400 lbs a ticket, Iris.",

Listen, we've got to talk about Mom's ashes. - What about them? - What we're gonna do with them, when? - I don't know. - We'll talk on Saturday. If you have to. Why are you wearing Mom's coat? And why have you got a wig on? I felt like it. - I don't think it's right. It's spooky. - I'll tell you what's spooky... All that love, and marriage, and Christmas together shit. It's too spooky. I can't stand it, I'd rather murder myself. I miss Mom. Don't start. I used to talk to her every day. \"I miss you\" Love, Gary. - You look so different, Iris. - D'you think so? - You're never gonna guess what? - What? I met this man. I slept with him straight away. - You're joking. - When I say \"slept\", we never slept. We had sex. His name is Tom. Did you use a condom? Well, what about Gary? Things are sort of complicated between us at the moment. Vron, he was incredible! - And you're together no more? Well, I've moved out for the moment.

It's different. I don't even know where you live. I told you - I'm in between flats at the moment. Have you got a girlfriend? Are you married? Tell me, I want to know. Look... It's not what you say... ...it's what you do that counts. - All we do is fuck. - What? I said, can you do a duck? I can't believe the state of Iris... D'you see what she had on the other day? - I couldn't really miss it, could I? - Do you think she's pretty? - Yes, of course she is. Think she's prettier than me? Of course not, don't be silly. She's got a great body, though. What? Rose, what? - Rose, it's just a joke, what? - You fancy her, don't you? - Come on, I don't fancy her... - You just said she had a great body! I said it, but it doesn't mean anything. It was a joke... What do you mean? That joke's not funny because you know how I feel. - I know how you feel at the moment. - You don't know actually, I feel fat! - What about the way that I feel? - Who cares... What do you mean? I have to put up with Rose this, Rose that... I have to put up with this great big bump, my sister, and my mother died... - If you wanna be somewhere else... - Where did that come from? Sorry I'm so fat, so boring and ugly. I'm sorry! I just want to sit down and have a quiet drink and a cuddle! What are you doing? Get off! Don't tickle me! Give us a kiss, fatty. - Are you ready yet? - What for? We will bury our Mom's ashes. I told you. - I haven't got them. - What do you mean? I lost them. What do you mean, you lost them? Well, where have you lost them? I don't know. By the time I realized, it was too late to find them. I don't believe you. I don't believe you! Show me where you've put them. You answer me! Iris, will you answer me! Where are Mom's ashes? This is important, where are they? Try and remember the last time you had them, we were at the crematorium. What are you doing? Are you showing off? You're showing off 'cause Chappy's here? Hello, my name is Rose, I'm her sister. You can't just lose Mom's ashes and pretend nothing's happened!"

I lose everything, in one month I lost: two pairs of shoes, a bag, a boyfriend, a mother... - Do you mind if I have a drink? - No, go on. Rose phoned me, you know. She told me what happened at the station. She can fuck off, she's got my ring! What is wrong with you two? I wish you'd stop fighting! - Don't start. - I'm not starting. - I care about you, I like you. - Yeah? Yeah, of course I do... Now go to bed. Stay. Just get some sleep... All right? - I can't sleep. - We'll talk in the morning. I don't wanna talk. Get some sleep. Good night. Frank? I can't sleep. Can I sleep in here with you? I don't think that would be a good idea, Iris. I'm lonely."
