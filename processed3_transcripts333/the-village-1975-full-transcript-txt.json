      "raw_text": "Miss Kono first visited us in mid-March, after a snowfall rare for Spring. Our village, Matsuo, is in Iwate Prefecture. One hour by train from Morioka, then 20 minutes by bus. Wait a moment. Miss Kono is with the Toitsu Troupe. She visits different districts where the troupe might perform. Hideko Kono, of the Toitsu Theatrical Troupe. The Superintendent told her where I lived. She decided to walk all the way. This was most surprising; it would take a man one hour to cover the distance. In Miss Kono's case, she probably plodded along, singing merrily along that hilly road. THE VILLAGE Screenplay by Yoji Yamada & Yoshitaka Asama Chieko Baisho Akira Terao Directed by Yoji Yamada Takashi's back. Are you the group's leader? The village office phoned about me. She's been waiting for you for one hour. I called the doctor. Difficult delivery. Birth expected tonight. A birth? Then you're going to be busy. If it’s a female... The first child could well be a boy. We'd sell a male for ¥3,000. ¥3,000! It's our cow. She's giving birth. I thought it was your wife! I'm not married yet. I'm Hideko Kono, of the Toitsu Troupe. I'm Takashi. From Tokyo? This milk is fresh from this morning. It looks good. Do you know Kichijoji? It's near our headquarters. About 15 minutes by train. Is there someone? My niece lives there. Married a man named Murakami. The house is in Midori-cho. Tokyo's too big a city. There'll be a birth there soon. They have a cow, too? Why, no, this is a human baby. Can't keep a cow in Tokyo! By then, it was time for the last bus. Miss Kono summed up her request and left hurriedly. I'll phone in April. She wanted to bring a show here, and asked for our youth group's cooperation. The idea was both sudden and startling. Our house seldom has visitors during wintertime. A charming person had come, laughed, and left. Kayoko. Why, Susumu! What are you doing here? I returned on vacation. Why? I wanted to see you. Brought your mail. Same old job? Did you get fired? This is a vacation. Tokyo has spruced you up. Why don't you come to our board meeting tonight? Who's the President? Takashi. Takashi? How did he become the President? No one else wanted to be. Those gone out to work returned. A meeting was held. A cook? In Kabuki-cho. Whereabouts? Near Koma?",

From the Toichi Troupe... Toitsu. Hideko Kono, of Toitsu. I'm glad to meet you. The purpose of her visit is to have a play staged here. She wants us to sponsor a musical called ‘Native Village’. Right? What kind of a play? Didn't I just tell you? ‘Native Village’. A musical that both the young and old can enjoy. Who are the stars? It's not mentioned here. Who are the leading actors? Our troupe isn't that famous. It doesn't appear on TV. We have no famous stars. No Sophia Loren! Any opinions? How about you, Kikuchi? I've nothing to say. I think it's a good idea to have a play performed here. What must we do? Takashi said for our Youth Association to 'sponsor it'. What does that mean? Miss Kono explained it to me. Supporting the performance in our village... means accepting responsibility. Responsibility? In case there's a deficit... Deficit? But why? It costs money to put on a play. Must we pay for it? If we sponsor it, our Youth Association will sell tickets. I understand. This group will pay money to buy the performance. A deal? How much? Miss Kono says the troupe's performance fee is ¥ 450,000. That isn't all, is it, Aiko? Lodging expenses for the troupe's 25 members to stay overnight, then posters, circulars, tickets, and so on... ¥ 200,000. Total: ¥ 650,000. For one show? ¥ 650,000 for one night. Can our group assume the responsibility? Any opinions? I don't see how we could ever do it. I thought it would be around ¥ 20,000. May I say a few words? Chuji just said that he thought... it would cost about ¥ 20,000. We'd like to do it for that, if it's possible. But just think for a moment... 25 people will arrive with a truck. Sets, props, lighting, and sound equipment, to entertain the audience with song and dance for three hours. What we earn as living expenses... comes to less than ¥ 200,000. Nor is that every day. Only about eight performances in one year: that's what our troupe is living on. The show is expensive. Meanwhile, utilities charges are going up. We'd like to do it for less, but this is the bare minimum. We're not doing this for the money. We love the theater.",

That won't be easy. It will be difficult, but don't give up too easily. That can be done at any time. Please consider the idea carefully. Any opinions? Something, Chuji? Why not do it? Come to my place. Welcome, Susumu. The last train has left. The train for Morioka? Is there an inn here? Well, there is, but... Kayoko! Can you put up Miss Kono for the night? I was wondering what she'd do. Sure, she can stay. I'd be troubling you too much. Her house is big. Dirty, too! Yes, but... Going to Chuji's place, Kayoko? Let's all go. Shall we? In my car. Nice drive-in. I modelled it after a place in Ueno where I once worked. I thought it had a Tokyo atmosphere! Handsome bartender... Are you staying in Morioka, at an inn? Rented a house for our office. Visit us sometime. You living alone? There are five of us. We visit different youth groups. Been doing it long? About 10 years. 10 years! Revealing my age! Our youth group lacks strength. It's shameful, but we've never done anything worthwhile. With such a leader... Why, you! Tetsuya... farmer? Public servant? Postal worker. Chuji, tell her about him. That story. What? You see, he wrote a love letter to a certain girl... What happened? Mailed it, then had to deliver it himself. It was part of my work. The girl wrote a letter of rejection, which he then delivered to his own house. Let's be friendly! I'll prepare some food. Dance, everybody. Will you dance with me? Great, Tetsuya! What about Tokyo? Takashi, when are you going to start work on that field? That field's no good. Carrots look promising. Last year's garlic was a big loss. The same thing with cabbage two years ago. So what? It's hopeless. Sit there. Do you intend to be a farmer or not? Which is it? I told you on New Year's: I'm not forcing it on you. If you're unwilling, I'll quit my factory job. The important thing is for you to make up your mind. Do you or don't you want to be a farmer? Despite what you say, you're forcing me into it.",

President of the youth group, eh? Can't farm decently. What a president! It's not my desire. Then quit! I will! After our father’s death, my brother worked hard to send me to school. I'm fully aware of that. Three years have passed since Brother's wife died. He hasn't remarried. It's hard for a widower with two children... to find a bride who'll live on a farm. It's a painful situation for Brother. I can understand how he feels. You worked for a while in Tokyo? - When was it? - After high school. For about two years. Where? A small, but nice boutique. I wanted to stay there, but Father kept telling me to return. He was worried? Our family has only girls. He wants me to marry an adopted son. I've made the bed. Thank you. The bath's ready. Nightgown. I have my own nightgown with me. I always carry it, because I never know where I might stay. Towel? Towel, too. Do you have parents? Yes, in Ibaraki. Why? When you began working, what did they say? They didn’t just say, “go ahead”. I'll have my bath. I do this quite often. Goodbye! Oh, I forgot that. Regards! Haven't installed a pipeline yet? No money. I guess you'd need 40 cows. I'm going back to Tokyo. You're not staying very long. I had a quarrel. I told my old man to sell the farm and start a drive-in. When I said I'd be the cook there, he punched me. That still here? We went after graduation to a Hokkaido ranch for training. We talked about starting a Danish-type farm together. Just a dream. I guess I'll go. How long to Tokyo? Eight hours by the new road. Faster than a train. If you come to Tokyo, look me up at my Chinese restaurant. Drive carefully. Listen, are you fond of Kayoko? Not especially. I see. Then it's all right. Goodbye. Many board meetings were held about the show. Kayoko's depressed look had me worried. I didn't care too much about the show... It will promote culture. How can we tell if it's a good show? Miss Kono explained it in detail. A village like this is the locale. A musical with young people, who are in love... Land prices rising as factories come in... To sell or not to sell... An enjoyable play. Easy to understand. Not interesting at all.",

I'm fully aware of that. Three years have passed since Brother's wife died. He hasn't remarried. It's hard for a widower with two children... to find a bride who'll live on a farm. It's a painful situation for Brother. I can understand how he feels. You worked for a while in Tokyo? - When was it? - After high school. For about two years. Where? A small, but nice boutique. I wanted to stay there, but Father kept telling me to return. He was worried? Our family has only girls. He wants me to marry an adopted son. I've made the bed. Thank you. The bath's ready. Nightgown. I have my own nightgown with me. I always carry it, because I never know where I might stay. Towel? Towel, too. Do you have parents? Yes, in Ibaraki. Why? When you began working, what did they say? They didn’t just say, “go ahead”. I'll have my bath. I do this quite often. Goodbye! Oh, I forgot that. Regards! Haven't installed a pipeline yet? No money. I guess you'd need 40 cows. I'm going back to Tokyo. You're not staying very long. I had a quarrel. I told my old man to sell the farm and start a drive-in. When I said I'd be the cook there, he punched me. That still here? We went after graduation to a Hokkaido ranch for training. We talked about starting a Danish-type farm together. Just a dream. I guess I'll go. How long to Tokyo? Eight hours by the new road. Faster than a train. If you come to Tokyo, look me up at my Chinese restaurant. Drive carefully. Listen, are you fond of Kayoko? Not especially. I see. Then it's all right. Goodbye. Many board meetings were held about the show. Kayoko's depressed look had me worried. I didn't care too much about the show... It will promote culture. How can we tell if it's a good show? Miss Kono explained it in detail. A village like this is the locale. A musical with young people, who are in love... Land prices rising as factories come in... To sell or not to sell... An enjoyable play. Easy to understand. Not interesting at all."

Young men keeping cows have to get up at 5 a.m. Marvellous to be young! But that sounds as if I weren't young. Actually, although I'm joking, I may not have been able to face you... Two days ago, when I was in the office... Luckily I was there. Takashi phoned, asking me to cancel the show. He would not give a reason, saying it was too shameful. Only two days left before the show, so I took a taxi and hurried here. What's happened? Chuji, what is it? You tell her, Takashi. It would be terrible to halt the show now. What is the reason?

I made a full report to you the next day. But after the decision. I knew nothing until then. I beg of you... please give us permission. I'm sorry. The gymnasium is an educational facility. It can't be used for money-making. This is different. You’re charging admission, aren't you? It’s too bad, but you'd better forget about it. May I ask a question? You say 'money-making' because admission is charged? Supposing it's free... The gymnasium is usable if there’s no charge? That stands to reason. Then we'll perform free! But that means that you'll get nothing... for performing in this village. It can't be helped. That sounds absurd, giving a performance without charge. We're not doing this just to make money. Performing for people who will enjoy our show... gives our lives meaning. A free performance will be a big blow financially, but this show must be given... for the sake of those expecting it, and for the young people who have worked so hard.",

        "Be sure not to blunder in front of the people. Hiroshi and I will come at 6. Drive carefully. Shigeru's eyes are bloodshot. He's only slept for two or three hours. Young men keeping cows have to get up at 5 a.m. Marvellous to be young! But that sounds as if I weren't young. Actually, although I'm joking, I may not have been able to face you... Two days ago, when I was in the office... Luckily I was there. Takashi phoned, asking me to cancel the show. He would not give a reason, saying it was too shameful. Only two days left before the show, so I took a taxi and hurried here. What's happened? Chuji, what is it? You tell her, Takashi. It would be terrible to halt the show now. What is the reason?
