Only bluebells. -Have a look. \"From the woods of Windsor Castle.\" Blimey. Devonshire cream for Mr. Benjamin Guggenheim. Drop it in the icebox. \"Happy maiden voyage, Mr. Guggenheim.\" \"Happy maiden voyage.\" They're in a blooming rut. \"Captain E.J. Smith.\" Deliver this to the bridge and hop to it! \"Mr. and Mrs. Straus.\" (band continues) (chattering) (band playing) With this lot we're taking on from the continent, we'll have 2,200 aboard. Rather thick weather inside the harbor, but it'll be clear when you get out. Cherbourg to New York. You'll go by the Great Circle Route. Yes, by southern track. A fine start, Captain. This is excellent tea. As for your running time, we know you'll exercise normal prudence. However, the company won't resent a record run on her maiden voyage. They're good engines, sir. We'll use 'em. Any other instructions from the company? With a ship like this, there isn't much to be said, except good luck. -And I wish I could go with you. -(laughing) Perhaps next time, sir. Yes, but that isn't a first sailing. For you, sir. I suppose my wife dug up an extra shirt. \"From Henry Evans, Benbecula, the Hebrides.\" Captain Henry Evans. I thought he was dead. (chuckles) It flew from the mainmast of the old Star of Madagascar nearly 40 years ago. I joined as an apprentice. She was a fine sea boat. Shall we hoist it, sir? She's not top issue nowadays, but up she goes. Mr. Sanderson. (band continues) CAPTAIN: Looks pretty good at that. The tender is coming up from Cherbourg, sir. Ah. Mr. Sanderson will go ashore on the tender. -Will you show him to the gangway? -Yes, sir. -Well, Captain, she's all yours. -Good-bye, sir. (whistle blasts) (whistle blows) MAN: Mind your helm. Steady as you go. (whistle blows) Julia? Julia! JULIA: Sandy! I thought you were in Biarritz. My beautiful Julia, to these ears Biarritz has become a dirty word. (chuckles) How much did you lose this time? These are borrowed trousers. Where's that husband of yours? -He didn't come. -Good! Maybe we can cause a scandal. I'm afraid that would be a little clumsy. I brought the children. What about your summer plans?",

Mama, look! Well, well! This ship is filled with nice people. -Hello, Mr. Sturges! -Richard! \"Pommery, 1892.\" Mrs. Straus, be careful of this old fox. He has plans. -NORMAN: Father. -Norman! -How did you get aboard? -By the back door. Good to see you, boy. -Hello, Sandy. -Well, I can see a bridge game at last! Mrs. Widener, George. -Annette. -Father. Julia. You all look splendid. This is gonna be great fun. I'll see to it that we have a better table tomorrow. Oh, Daddy, I'm so glad you're here. I hope this doesn't upset your plans, Julia. We might be a little crowded, but Norman and I can bunk together. -It's wonderful that you could get away after all. -I managed. My family will be pleased that you're coming too. It makes it a better celebration already. Can I send a message to Grandfather? They have a wireless place upstairs. The Marconi room. Might be a good idea. Run along. Nothing now. Thank you. I'll have a sandwich in the bar. Annette, I wonder if you'd get a wrap for your mother. Yes, angel. There's something funny about you, Father. I know! I've never seen you without a flower before. Finish your coffee, Julia. We can walk around the deck while I tell you what I think of this performance of yours. I'm in no hurry to finish my coffee and not too interested in your opinion. If I hadn't phoned the house from Zurich, you'd have got away with it.",

MAUDE: She didn't believe my eagle was real. I said, \"What do you want him to do? Flap his wings?\"  Mama, you should've protested. It's a really bad table. There's not a person we know at this end of the room. JULIA: Be brave, Annette. These tragedies happen sometimes in life. Maitre d'hotel, where is Mrs. Sturges's table? Mama, look! Well, well! This ship is filled with nice people. -Hello, Mr. Sturges! -Richard! \"Pommery, 1892.\" Mrs. Straus, be careful of this old fox. He has plans. -NORMAN: Father. -Norman! -How did you get aboard? -By the back door. Good to see you, boy. -Hello, Sandy. -Well, I can see a bridge game at last! Mrs. Widener, George. -Annette. -Father. Julia. You all look splendid. This is gonna be great fun. I'll see to it that we have a better table tomorrow. Oh, Daddy, I'm so glad you're here. I hope this doesn't upset your plans, Julia. We might be a little crowded, but Norman and I can bunk together. -It's wonderful that you could get away after all. -I managed. My family will be pleased that you're coming too. It makes it a better celebration already. Can I send a message to Grandfather? They have a wireless place upstairs. The Marconi room. Might be a good idea. Run along. Nothing now. Thank you. I'll have a sandwich in the bar. Annette, I wonder if you'd get a wrap for your mother. Yes, angel. There's something funny about you, Father. I know! I've never seen you without a flower before. Finish your coffee, Julia. We can walk around the deck while I tell you what I think of this performance of yours. I'm in no hurry to finish my coffee and not too interested in your opinion. If I hadn't phoned the house from Zurich, you'd have got away with it."

They're going to stop being rootless, purposeless, superficial hotel children. -What's wrong with hotels if they're very good ones? -Oh, Richard, I... Richard, please try to see this sanely.

Do you think Annette is going to be grateful to you for hauling her into the wilderness? In time. And as for Norman, I can only tell you this: there's not going to be a carriage with two ponies waiting for him at nine o'clock every morning. From now on, he's going to walk to school. Hm. I should've anticipated this. Twenty years ago I made the pardonable mistake of thinking I could civilize a girl who bought her hats out of a Sears Roebuck catalog. I was wrong. And don't think I haven't had my share of regrets. One thing, Richard, you've... You've always been honest. -Will this one do? -Yes, thank you. -Where's Father? But-- -Never mind. It's bedtime.

The dear, arthritic old princess sitting under the finest crystal chandelier in Europe, and Mr. Paderewski complaining about the draft... and at the end of the table, one young man next to an empty chair with a tear in his eye. A crystal tear is my guess. -What excuse did you give him, Annette? -I dropped them a note. -Let's go, Richard. -What note? Was I to be somewhere? It's perfectly all right if your mother explained it to them. See you later, Annette. Wait a minute. Explain it to me. What's the difference one party more or less? Now, Julia, a luncheon at the Metternichs' is not exactly a wiener roast. Was there some reason I wasn't told I was invited to the Metternichs'? Annette, your mother's a sensible woman. She probably felt something might come of it. Some involvement with the young master. To be perfectly frank, I was afraid. He's an arrogant little toad. Mm. He does look a little like a toad, but he's a highly eligible toad. Not many young men are related to both the Metternichs and the Rothschilds. I don't think he looks in the least like a toad. I see no reason we couldn't have left a week later. I'm sorry I'm not there and I think it was mean of you! RICHARD: Annette, mind your manners! It wasn't a question of a week or two weeks. This was as good a time as any to bow out. -Bow out? -Yes. I'm afraid so. Adieu, great world. Your father is saying that I'm taking you home for good. You may as well know it now. I won't see an arranged marriage, I won't see you jumping from party to party, from title to title, all the rest of your life.",

I remember a man like that in the old days. Always afraid we were carrying too much sail. But the wind never did us any harm. I like your spirit, Mr. Lightoller. Thank you, sir. -All right if I skip now, Mother? Big match coming up. -Yes, dear. I believe that's your trick, Widener. Are you leaving it there to hatch? (chuckles) Sorry, Sturges. I'm knocked out. It's almost 10:30, Father. We should have a warm-up. This may be a tough match. You'll have to find someone else, Norman. I'm busy. -Yes, sir. -SANDY: An evenhanded rubber. That's enough for me. I guess it's time for us all to quit. I see no reason for stopping. We'll get a fourth. I'll be glad to fill in, Mr. Sturges, if it's all right with everybody? Please do. Cut. The name's Meeker. Earl Meeker. All right. Let's have more coffee and double the stakes. -How much do I owe? -We'll let you know. Excuse me, Father, but if you're busy, maybe I could have the match postponed-- I told you, Norman, I'm not interested in the match. Find someone else! Yes, sir. -RICHARD: A spade. -SANDY: Pass. MAUDE: Two hearts. He certainly clouded up. Well, a word'll do it faster than a hickory stick anytime. A spade, two hearts. Your call. MEEKER: I pass. Morning. Hello. I guess it's of no importance, but I wanted to tell you something about last night. No need to. You danced with me four times. It's more than I figured on. No, I mean the way I walked off without saying anything. It wasn't very adult of me, and I believe in being adult. Forget it. You did your bit. Only I kind of figured you were having a good time. -To be frank, I was. -So you left me standing right in the middle of the floor? That's just it! I didn't know what to do when the orchestra started playing that funny dance. -What do they call it? -\"The Navajo Rag\"? -That's the one. I'd never heard it-- -Never heard it before? Where have you been? Locked up in some art gallery? Why, that's the hottest jig that kids do! Yes, I noticed those girls with your friends. They seemed to... well... shake automatically, especially the pretty one with the dark hair. Oh, the dark-haired one!",

        "-Anything else? -No, sir. Er... Mr. and Mrs. Astor, I should like you to meet our second officer, Mr. Lightoller. How do you do? -He's worried about our ship. -Not worried, sir. I remember a man like that in the old days. Always afraid we were carrying too much sail. But the wind never did us any harm. I like your spirit, Mr. Lightoller. Thank you, sir. -All right if I skip now, Mother? Big match coming up. -Yes, dear. I believe that's your trick, Widener. Are you leaving it there to hatch?  Sorry, Sturges. I'm knocked out. It's almost 10:30, Father. We should have a warm-up. This may be a tough match. You'll have to find someone else, Norman. I'm busy. -Yes, sir. -SANDY: An evenhanded rubber. That's enough for me. I guess it's time for us all to quit. I see no reason for stopping. We'll get a fourth. I'll be glad to fill in, Mr. Sturges, if it's all right with everybody? Please do. Cut. The name's Meeker. Earl Meeker. All right. Let's have more coffee and double the stakes. -How much do I owe? -We'll let you know. Excuse me, Father, but if you're busy, maybe I could have the match postponed-- I told you, Norman, I'm not interested in the match. Find someone else! Yes, sir. -RICHARD: A spade. -SANDY: Pass. MAUDE: Two hearts. He certainly clouded up. Well, a word'll do it faster than a hickory stick anytime. A spade, two hearts. Your call. MEEKER: I pass. Morning. Hello. I guess it's of no importance, but I wanted to tell you something about last night. No need to. You danced with me four times. It's more than I figured on. No, I mean the way I walked off without saying anything. It wasn't very adult of me, and I believe in being adult. Forget it. You did your bit. Only I kind of figured you were having a good time. -To be frank, I was. -So you left me standing right in the middle of the floor? That's just it! I didn't know what to do when the orchestra started playing that funny dance. -What do they call it? -\"The Navajo Rag\"? -That's the one. I'd never heard it-- -Never heard it before? Where have you been? Locked up in some art gallery? Why, that's the hottest jig that kids do! Yes, I noticed those girls with your friends. They seemed to... well... shake automatically, especially the pretty one with the dark hair. Oh, the dark-haired one!"
