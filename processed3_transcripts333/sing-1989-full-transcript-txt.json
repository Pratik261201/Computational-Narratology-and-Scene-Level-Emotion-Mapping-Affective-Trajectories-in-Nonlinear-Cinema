I'm Mickey Glaser. Mickey, looking very good. That's what I'm afraid of. This year I got a problem. No, what's he doing? Come on, once you're both elected, it'll be business as usual. You see, my grandmother, she just started recently coughing and coughing... Yo! Can I leave now? I voted. Hey, hey. What'd you do? Hang nail. (LAUGHING) Look, can I get out of here? Simeti, right? Yeah. Yeah. Look, uh... I got plans, all right? No. No. Sit down, Simeti. I think you might find this very interesting. Oh, Jesus. And from the sophomore class, Zena Ward! Come on down!

Miss Lombardo. I don't want to be in show business. Who does? I mean, we don't do Sing because we want a career, we do it for the experience and for the fun of it. I got other ideas about fun. You know who you look like? WOMAN: No. Meryl Streep. I bet. I was very surprised, Mr. Simeti, to dig out your school files and discover that you've got a record of drug possession, petty larceny, assault. So I got it covered. And you're on a court order probation. Yeah. See, I've been out of Brooklyn a while, but I thought that while you're on probation there are certain things that you didn't wanna do.",

        "As you know, Sing is the annual musical competition between the seniors and the underclassmen. The Sing leaders that you elect today are responsible for creating and running the entire show. Excuse me, can I get you to put both feet on the floor? I don't do tricks. STUDENTS: Ohhh! TERESA: This afternoon your last period will be canceled.  You are all required to be at the elections for your Sing leaders. GIRL: Come on! Miss Lombardo? Yeah. I'm Mickey Glaser. Mickey, looking very good. That's what I'm afraid of. This year I got a problem. No, what's he doing? Come on, once you're both elected, it'll be business as usual. You see, my grandmother, she just started recently coughing and coughing... Yo! Can I leave now? I voted. Hey, hey. What'd you do? Hang nail.  Look, can I get out of here? Simeti, right? Yeah. Yeah. Look, uh... I got plans, all right? No. No. Sit down, Simeti. I think you might find this very interesting. Oh, Jesus. And from the sophomore class, Zena Ward! Come on down!  It's not fair. Zena's co-leader is a junior, Aristotle Thermopolis.    Get out of there. Get out of there! Save that tongue for licking stamps. Whoo! Hannah Gottschalk!  And Hannah's co-leader, it was a close one and I'm sure you've all got your individual favorites. But I've counted and I've re-counted, and there's no doubt about it. Hannah's co-leader for this year's Sing victory is Dominic Simeti!   Mr. Simeti. I brought you over a tentative rehearsal schedule. What? Well, you left so quickly. Look, Miss... What's your name? Lombardo. Miss Lombardo. I don't want to be in show business. Who does? I mean, we don't do Sing because we want a career, we do it for the experience and for the fun of it. I got other ideas about fun. You know who you look like? WOMAN: No. Meryl Streep. I bet. I was very surprised, Mr. Simeti, to dig out your school files and discover that you've got a record of drug possession, petty larceny, assault. So I got it covered. And you're on a court order probation. Yeah. See, I've been out of Brooklyn a while, but I thought that while you're on probation there are certain things that you didn't wanna do."

You can spend the next three to five sucking up slop from an aluminum tray in a filthy prison cafeteria, or you could show up and serve your class as senior Sing leader. Either way, your ass is mine.

        "It wouldn't have to cost anybody anything. Young lady, you are out of order. DOMINIC: Hey! Hey! Hey, let her talk! Mr. Scarpetti, you own a paint store, right? You could give us some paint, huh? I'll give them all the paint they need.  I have lumber. Anybody needs lumber, they got it. Atta boy!  Mr. Frye! Hey, Mr. Frye, look at this. Cecilia, show him your splits.  That's my daughter. We want Sing! Yeah. Yeah! Sing!  Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Listen to me! Listen to me! No! No. Elliot Frye may be closing down this school, but as long as I'm principal, he's not gonna tell me how to run it. I've been working too long inside this system not to find a way to work outside it, Teresa. And no four-eyed son of a bitch from the Board of Education is gonna stop me from giving my kids one final Sing! HANNAH: All right, you guys. They're gonna close our school, we can't stop them.  They're telling us we're not worth anything, Mr. Marowitz has put his ass on the line for us to prove different. So, we've got to do everything we can away from the school so nobody at the Board of Ed finds out. I don't know where the underclassmen are hiding out to rehearse, but you gotta remember they got Mrs. DeVere. ALL: Ooh. And we all know Mrs. DeVere. She doesn't take defeat lightly. Let's get something straight! We're either gonna make history, or we're gonna be history. You think you're tired now? Well, you ain't seen tired yet. You think you got a winning show? Well, you better pick up the pace right now or we all might as well pack up our buns and go home! Now get back to work.  Take it from the top. Hit it! You got something you wanna add?  I didn't wanna have to do this. But it's like I always say. You've got to get them on their feet before you can kick them in the ass. Now give me that. ♪ I've got my eye on you ♪ I send my thoughts straight in your direction ♪ But am I getting through? ♪ Day and night I'm trying to make the connection ♪ I've studied every book ♪ I've rented videos, hoping for assistance ♪ I watch your every look ♪ But it's so hard to love you from a distance ♪ Help me out! ♪ I don't sleep I don't eat ♪ I keep pounding my brain I keep pounding the beat ♪ I want you ♪ And that's no exaggeration ♪ I'm prepared to give you ♪ Total concentration ♪ Ah, yes Ooh!"
