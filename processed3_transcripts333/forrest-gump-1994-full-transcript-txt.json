      "raw_text": "(BUS APPROACHING) Hello. My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump. Do you want a chocolate? I could eat about a million and a half of these. My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. Those must be comfortable shoes. I'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that. My feet hurt. Mama always said there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their shoes: Where they're going, where they've been. I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard, I could remember my first pair of shoes. Mama said they'd take me anywhere. She said they was my magic shoes. All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now. Let's take a little walk around. How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump, as strong as I've ever seen, but his back is as crooked as a politician. But we're gonna straighten him right up, now, aren't we, Forrest? Forrest! FORREST: Now, when I was a baby, Mama named me after the great Civil War hero, General Nathan Bedford Forrest. She said we was related to him in some way. And what he did was, he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something. They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around. And anyway, that's how I got my name, Forrest Gump. Mama said that the \"Forrest\" part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense. (CLANG) Okay... Get it, get it... Wait, is it this way? Hold on. All right... What are you all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before? Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest. If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs. FORREST: Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them. We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17, about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in the county of Greenbow. Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about 1,000 years ago, something like that. Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms, Mama decided to let those rooms out, mostly to people passing through, like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.",

You're the same as everybody else. You are no different. Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump. Now, his IQ is 75. Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock. FORREST: She wanted me to have the finest education, so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School. I met the principal and all. I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump. Now, this is normal. Forrest is right here. The state requires a minimum IQ of 80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump. He's gonna have to go to a special school. Now, he'll be just fine. What does \"normal\" mean, anyway? He might be a bit on the slow side, but my boy Forrest is gonna get the same opportunities as everyone else. He's not going to some special school to learn how to re-tread tires. We're talking about five little points here. There must be something can be done. We're a progressive school system. We don't want to see anybody left behind. Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump? He's on vacation. (GASPING AND PANTING) Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son. You don't say much, do you? (GASPING AND PANTING) \"Finally, he had to try. \"It looked easy, but, \"oh, what happened. - \"First, there...\" - Mama, what's \"vacation\" mean? - Vacation? - Where Daddy went. Vacation's when you go somewhere and you don't ever come back. FORREST: Anyway, I guess you could say me and Mama was on our own. But we didn't mind. Our house was never empty. There was always folks coming and going. MRS. GUMP: Supper. - It's supper, everyone. Forrest... - My, my. That sure looks special. FORREST: Sometimes we had so many people staying with us that every room was filled with travelers. You know, folks living out of their suitcases and hat cases and sample cases. Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest... One time, a young man was staying with us, and he had him a guitar case. (SINGING HOUND DOG) Forrest! I told you not to bother this nice young man. ELVIS PRESLEY: Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I was just showing him a thing or two on the guitar here. All right, but your supper's ready if y'all want to eat. Yeah, that sounds good.

Forrest Gump. From that day on, we was always together. Jenny and me was like peas and carrots. She taught me how to climb. Come on, Forrest, you can do it. I showed her how to dangle. \"...a good little monkey and...\" She helped me learn how to read, and I showed her how to swing.

Hey, dummy! Are you retarded, or just plain stupid? - \"Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.\" - JENNY: Just run away, Forrest. Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry! - Get the bikes! - BOY 1: Hurry up! Let's get him! - Come on! - Look out, dummy, here we come! We're gonna get you! Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest! Come back here, you! Run, Forrest! Run! FORREST: Now, you wouldn't believe it if I told you, but I can run like the wind blows. From that day on, if I was going somewhere, I was running! BOY 1: He's getting away! Stop him! That boy sure is a running fool. Now, remember how I told you that Jenny never seemed to want to go home? Well, she lived in a house that was as old as Alabama. Her mama had gone up to heaven when she was five, and her daddy was some kind of a farmer. Jenny? He was a very loving man. He was always kissing and touching her and her sisters. And then this one time, Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school. Jenny, why didn't you come to school today? (SHUSHES) Daddy's taking a nap. - MR. CURRAN: Jenny! - Come on! MR. CURRAN: Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd better get back here, girl! Where you at? Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny! Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me. MR. CURRAN: Jenny! Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here. Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here. Mama always said that God is mysterious. Jenny! He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day. You'd better get back here! Instead, he had the police say Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more. She went to live with her grandma just over on Creekmore Avenue, which made me happy, 'cause she was so close. Some nights, Jenny would sneak out and come on over to my house, just 'cause she said she was scared. Scared of what, I don't know, but I think it was her grandma's dog. He was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends all the way up through high school. - Hey, stupid! - Quit it! - Run, Forrest, run! - Hey, did you hear me, stupid? - Run, Forrest! - Come on, get in the truck! BOY 1: Get in the truck! Let's move it! Come on, he's getting away!",

FORREST: Now, you wouldn't believe it if I told you, but I can run like the wind blows. From that day on, if I was going somewhere, I was running! BOY 1: He's getting away! Stop him! That boy sure is a running fool. Now, remember how I told you that Jenny never seemed to want to go home? Well, she lived in a house that was as old as Alabama. Her mama had gone up to heaven when she was five, and her daddy was some kind of a farmer. Jenny? He was a very loving man. He was always kissing and touching her and her sisters. And then this one time, Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school. Jenny, why didn't you come to school today?  Daddy's taking a nap. - MR. CURRAN: Jenny! - Come on! MR. CURRAN: Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd better get back here, girl! Where you at? Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny! Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me. MR. CURRAN: Jenny! Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here. Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here. Mama always said that God is mysterious. Jenny! He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day. You'd better get back here! Instead, he had the police say Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more. She went to live with her grandma just over on Creekmore Avenue, which made me happy, 'cause she was so close. Some nights, Jenny would sneak out and come on over to my house, just 'cause she said she was scared. Scared of what, I don't know, but I think it was her grandma's dog. He was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends all the way up through high school. - Hey, stupid! - Quit it! - Run, Forrest, run! - Hey, did you hear me, stupid? - Run, Forrest! - Come on, get in the truck! BOY 1: Get in the truck! Let's move it! Come on, he's getting away!"

What you do is, you just drag your nets along the bottom. On a good day, you can catch over 100 pounds of shrimp.

You told me to, Drill Sergeant. Jesus H. Christ, this is a new company record. If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd recommend you for OCS, Private Gump. You are gonna be a general some day, Gump. Now, disassemble your weapon and continue! Anyway, like I was saying, shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saut? it. There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole... ...shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp... ...shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich... That's... That's about it. FORREST: Night time in the Army is a lonely time. We'd lay there in our bunks and I'd miss my mama. And I'd miss Jenny. Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her! Turns out, Jenny had gotten into some trouble over some photos of her in her college sweater, and she was thrown out of school. But that wasn't a bad thing, because a man who owns a theater in Memphis, Tennessee, saw those photos and offered Jenny a job singing in a show.

You know why we a good partnership, Forrest? 'Cause we be watching out for one another, like brothers and stuff. Hey, Forrest, there's something I've been thinking about. I got a very important question to ask you. How would you like to go into the shrimping business with me? Okay. Man, I tell you what, I got it all figured out, too. So many pounds of shrimp to pay off the boat, so many pounds for gas, we can just live right on the boat. We ain't got to pay no rent. I'll be the captain, we can just work it together, split everything right down the middle. Man, I'm telling you, 50-50. And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat. That's a fine idea. FORREST: Bubba did have a fine idea. I even wrote Jenny and told her all about it. I sent her letters, not every day, but almost. I told her what I was doing and asked her what she was doing, and told her how I thought about her always, and how I was looking forward to getting a letter from her just as soon as she had the time. I'd always let her know that I was okay. Then, I'd sign each letter, \"Love, Forrest Gump.\" This one day, we was out walking, like always, and then, just like that, somebody turned off the rain and the sun come out. DAN: Ambush! Take cover! (GUNS FIRING) Get down! Get the sixty!",

Well, well, I had company. Hey, hey! We was just there. That's at Times Square. Don't you just love New Year's? You get to start all over. - CARLA: Hey, Lenore... - Everybody gets a second chance.

Shrimping is tough. I only caught five. A couple more, you could have yourself a cocktail. (CHUCKLING) Hey, you ever think about naming this old boat? It's bad luck to have a boat without a name. I'd never named a boat before, but there was only one I could think of, the most beautiful name in the wide world.

Yeah, but don't you be thinking that I'm going to be calling you \"sir.\" No, sir. That's my boat.

Gump, what are you doing? Take a left! Left! That's where we're going to find those shrimp, my boy! That's where we'll find them. - Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan. - Okay, so I was wrong. How are we going to find them? Well, maybe you should just pray for shrimp. (SINGING GOSPEL MUSIC) FORREST: So, I went to church every Sunday.

I had to see this for myself. And I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain that I'd be your first mate. Well, here I am. - I am a man of my word. - Okay. Yeah, but don't you be thinking that I'm going to be calling you \"sir.\" No, sir. That's my boat.

Gump, what are you doing? Take a left! Left! That's where we're going to find those shrimp, my boy! That's where we'll find them. - Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan. - Okay, so I was wrong. How are we going to find them? Well, maybe you should just pray for shrimp.  FORREST: So, I went to church every Sunday.
