How could she relate to their suffering? How could she help these people? So guess what all these people wanted to talk about... ...with my friend Deborah, the psychologist. lt was all, \"l met this guy in the refugee camp. I thought he really loved me, but when we got separated... ...he took up with my cousin. Now he says he loves me... ...and keeps calling me. They're married now.

Happy to see you. i am Ketut Liyer. Nope. i wanna discuss my relationship. You are a world traveler. You will live a long time... ...have many friends, many experiences. You will have two marriages. One long, one short. Am i in the long one or the short one? Can't tell. Also you will lose all your money. I think in next six to 10 months. Don't worry. You will get it all back again. And you will come back to Bali... ...and live here for three or four months and teach me English. I never had anybody to practice my English with. And then... ...l will teach you everything i know. Wait. I have this for you. Keep grounded so it's like you have four legs. That way, you can stay in this world. Also, no looking at world through your head. Look through your heart instead. That way, you will know God. Which is why you came here, no? See you later, alligator. I proofread all of her manuscripts. My wife is very, very beautiful, but she can't spell for anything. Look at Uncle Stephen. And Auntie Liz. I'm counting the minutes for this to be over so i can get in my big girl pants.",

You know who i was talking to at the party who was really inspiring... -...was Tara's friend. -Brian. Brian. Unbelievable. He's a teacher, you know that? He's a substitute teacher, isn't he? Yeah. He was talking about the budget cuts that are happening now. There's no money for anything. There's no music classes, there's no arts classes. They're volunteering their time to do all of this after school. They're educating our kids, you know?",

Not the last time I was out of work, the time before that. And i just had this feeling like I was looking in all the wrong places. Looking for what? God. She has an ashram in India. I'm dying to go, but... ...you know, you have to get, like, three stages of hepatitis shots... ...and my insurance always runs out. I'll go when the time's right.

And i love that when we're together, I can make it go away. -Oh, he's good. -You're love... -He's hot, there's a difference. -...is like a hot panini. And when I look into your eyes, I hear dolphins clapping. I did not write that line. Here's what he doesn't know yet. I disappear into the person i love. I am the permeable membrane. If i love you, you can have it all. My money, my time, my body... ...my dog, my dog's money. I will assume your debts and project upon you... ...all sorts of nifty qualities you've never actually cultivated in yourself. I will give you all this and more... ...until i am so exhausted and depleted... ...the only way i can recover... ...is by becoming infatuated with someone else. -Elizabeth, hi. -Hi. Oh, really? How you doing? Cheers. -Thank you. -l owe you an apology. -For the walkouts. -Well, l'm not everyone's cup of tea. I doubt that. I, on the other hand, was shit. -Although i was trying very hard. -\"Shit\" is a strong word. Thank you. You seem shorter in person than on the stage. -Really? i hear that a lot. -Sorry. It's okay. It's unnerving when... ...a total stranger sees you more clearly than you see yourself. That's what i mean by saying you're short. Are you hearing dolphins clapping right now? I took a few liberties with your material. I give you full permission to make fun of me. I know you're dying to. You're far too charming to make fun of. I'm still hearing them. Is that your guru? You're joking, but, yes, it is. She's beautiful. Yeah. A friend told me about her. I was out of work and feeling pretty desperate for something. Not the last time I was out of work, the time before that. And i just had this feeling like I was looking in all the wrong places. Looking for what? God. She has an ashram in India. I'm dying to go, but... ...you know, you have to get, like, three stages of hepatitis shots... ...and my insurance always runs out. I'll go when the time's right. There's a gathering of her students every morning. If you want, I could take you sometime."

Right at meeting of heaven and earth. Not too much God, not too much selfish. Otherwise, life too crazy. You lose balance, you lose power. In morning, you do meditation from India. Serious. Very serious. In day, you enjoy Bali. Then in afternoon, come see me. End of day, you do new meditation. Very simple. Sit in silence and smile. I feel balanced already. Not so easy, Liss. Smile with face. Smile with mind. Even smile in liver. See you later, alligator. Oh, God. -Are you all right? -Are you blind? -Please, let me take you to a doctor. -l'm fine. i just-- It looks bad. Very bad, Liss. -What happen? -This idiot ran me off the road. A man? He rich? This very hot. -You need healer. -l have you. You're a medicine man. -No. You need Wayan. -Yeah. Jamu. Drink this. Better than antibiotic. She make you drink this? -My name's Liz. What's yours? -Tutti. Nice to meet you, Tutti. -Are you married? -No. You sure? Not even once? Okay, well, there was this one time... ...but i find when i tell people in Bali that I'm divorced, it upsets them. Me too, divorce. Divorce make you sad and make you an outcast. You have no sex for a long time, baby. I can tell by your knee. The cartilage very dry. Hormones from sex lubricate joint. -Okay. -l pray for you. We sisters. Armenia! Armenia from Brazil. Armenia, this is Liz from New York. -Hi. -Lovely to meet you, Liz. Time for a banana root hair treatment? -Yes, of course. -lt makes the hair long and lustrous. Like Cher circa 1 975. Do you have a nice dress? One. Put it on tonight, come to the Beach Shack. I'll introduce you to everyone. The expats, the locals. You'll dance. You will love it. Oh, no, i don't think I can dance with my leg like this. Of course you can. Leg no problem. You see. Now you have to come. Hi. Could I get a tequila on the rocks with a lot of lime, please?

They are dangerous. -A week is too short. -Yeah. -A week is too short. -Yup. Listen, l've made you a mixtape. And i give you a present. For you. Thank you. I'm missing you already. Bye, Liz. -Be safe. -Same to you. So don't I get a kiss? I don't know. -l love you, Dad. -l love you too. So stupid, I know. He's 1 9 years old and he's such a man."
