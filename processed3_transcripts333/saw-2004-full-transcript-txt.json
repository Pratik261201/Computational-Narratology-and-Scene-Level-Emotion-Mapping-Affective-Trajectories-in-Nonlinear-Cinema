      "raw_text": "Help! Someone help me! Is someone there? Oh, shit. I'm probably dead. - You're not dead. - Who's that? Turn on the lights! Wish I could. What the fuck is going on? Where am I? I don't know yet. What is that smell? I don't see a thing, asshole. Shit! Help! No one can hear you. - What the fuck is this? - Calm down. Just calm down. - Are you hurt? - I don't know. Yeah! What's your name? My name is very fucking confused. What's your name? What's going on here? My name is Lawrence Gordon. I'm a doctor. I just woke up here. Just like you. - Recognize that man? - No. - Do you have any idea how you got here? - No. - What's the last thing you remember? - Nothing. I went to bed in my shit-hole apartment and woke up in an actual shit-hole. What about you? There's not much to tell really. I was on my way home from work and I don't remember anything else. First dead body I've ever seen. Look different in real life. They don't move. From the looks of these chains... someone didn't want us to go very far either. - Can you see any scars? - What? This is what they do. They kidnap you and drug you... and before you know it, you're in a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay. - No one has taken your kidneys. - How can you tell from way over there? Because you'd either be in terrible agony or you'd be dead by now. Trust me. - What are you, a surgeon? - Yeah. So, you going to tell me your name or what? Adam. Well, Adam... what we need to do... is start thinking about why we are here. Whoever brought us here could've killed us by now. But they didn't. They must want something from us. Question is what. - That clock. - What about it? - It's brand-new. - So? So somebody obviously wanted us to know the time. Wait. I think I might be able to reach the door. What is that? Excuse me. - It's a tape. - Where did you find it? It was in my pocket. It says \"Play me.\" Come on. Throw it over here. No? - Use your shirt. - What? Your shirt. Come on. It won't work. Look around. There must be something else you can use. - There's nothing. - There must be something. Come on. You can do it. Come on. Again. Rise and shine, Adam. You're probably wondering where you are. I'll tell you where you might be. You might be in the room that you die in. Up until now, you simply sat in the shadows... watching others live out their lives.",

Look, we're going to have to work together if we want to get out of here. Now, just throw it to me. I'm not going to risk breaking it. You throw me your tape. Dr. Gordon. This is your wake-up call. Every day of your working life, you have given people the news... that they are going to die soon. Now you will be the cause of death. Your aim in this game is to kill Adam. You have until 6:00 on the clock to do it. There's a man in the room with you. When there is that much poison in your blood, the only thing left to do... is shoot yourself. There are ways to win this... hidden all around you. Just remember: \"X\" marks the spot for the treasure. If you do not kill Adam by 6:00... then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And I'll leave you in this room to rot. Let the game begin. Give me that. Now. ... then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And I will leave you in this room to rot. Any idea who that is? Let the game begin. - He knows us. - Come on. What do you think? Probably a joke, right? Let the game begin. Listen. Follow your heart. What the hell does \"follow your heart\" mean? There, right next to you, on the toilet. Come on. - Anything? - No solids. Take off the lid. I really wish I had checked in there first. What is it? Mind passing me the other one? Fuck! He doesn't want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet. I think I may know who's done this to us. - What did you say? - It's not someone I know personally. It's just someone I know of. Jesus Christ! Tell me. Who is it? The last I heard... the police still hadn't caught him. And the only reason I know that is because I was a suspect. I'll start from the beginning. This one's not fresh anymore. At least three weeks out. Victim's a 46-year-old male. Died of massive blood loss. Mostly through the femoral artery. He started at the back of the cage... and tunneled his way through that razor wire so fast... it's amazing he got as far as he did. Cut himself so deep, we found traces of stomach acid on the floor.",

Did you hurt yourself because you truly wanted to die... or did you just want some attention? Tonight, you'll show me. The irony is that if you want to die you just have to stay where you are. But if you want to live, you'll have to cut yourself again. One path through the razor wire to the door. But hurry. At 3:00 that door will lock... and then this room becomes your tomb. How much blood will you shed to stay alive, Paul? The door was on a timer. It was unlocked until 3:00. Then it snapped shut. He was given two hours. Jigsaw piece. I think I'm gonna be here for a while. The newspapers started calling him the \"Jigsaw killer.\" Actually, technically speaking, he is... not really a murderer. He never killed anyone. He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. Hello, Mark, if you're so sick... then why do I have so many photos of you up and about? Let's put your so-called illness to the test. Right now, there is a slow-acting poison in your veins. The antidote is inside the safe. The combination to the safe... is written on the wall. Hurry up and program it in. But watch your step. By the way, that's flammable substance smeared on your body. So I would be careful with that candle, if I were you... Help. ... or all the people you've burned with your act... just might have their revenge. I found something else. Well, two things actually. There was someone standing outside here watching through this peephole. Looks like our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his sick games. He was there at the last one as well. Only this time, he left us his penlight. - Get a rush on the prints. - Copy that. Okay. This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor... extending across the midline. Started as a colon cancer. The patient has come in for a standard checkup... by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining. - The patient had... - His name is John, Dr. Gordon. He's a very interesting person. Thank you for that information, Zep. As you can see, our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients. Continuing on, the patient...

I do my best. Sorry to interrupt you while you're working. That's fine. How can I help you, gentlemen? Tell us where you were... between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. last night, Doctor. Why is it that you're interested? We'd like to ask you a few questions about it. For your sake, I think it's best if we do it down at the station. Would you like to follow us there? No. I'm afraid that's quite out of the question. I can't just leave, I have work to do. Plus, my wife has the car today. That's okay. You can ride with us, Doc. I'm sorry, you'll have to tell me again. What is this all about? Is this yours, Doctor? So you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene? Of course not. I'll have to ask. What were you doing last night? I was seeing someone. Who? Look, if you can't be honest with me... I was visiting someone. It wasn't a patient. What am I gonna do? Well, as your lawyer and your friend, my advice to you is to bite the bullet... and give them your alibi now. Because no one is going to believe you later. That was five months ago. He tried to set me up for murder. Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds up. Good. Can I go home now? We have one of the victims who managed to escape. Want to know if you wouldn't mind sticking around and listening to her testimony? - Maybe it'll trigger something. - I'd like to help really but... We'd really appreciate it. - She's the only one who made it. - Okay. Amanda... in your own time... tell me the first thing you remember. I woke up. All I could taste was blood... and metal. Hello, Amanda. You don't know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Here's what happens if you lose. The device you're wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. When the timer at the back goes off... your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, I'll show you. There is only one key to open the device. It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around, Amanda. Know that I'm not lying. You better hurry up. Live or die. Make your choice. And then I saw the body. There was a knife. He'd been injected with an opiate overdose.",

No. I'm afraid that's quite out of the question. I can't just leave, I have work to do. Plus, my wife has the car today. That's okay. You can ride with us, Doc. I'm sorry, you'll have to tell me again. What is this all about? Is this yours, Doctor? So you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene? Of course not. I'll have to ask. What were you doing last night? I was seeing someone. Who? Look, if you can't be honest with me... I was visiting someone. It wasn't a patient. What am I gonna do? Well, as your lawyer and your friend, my advice to you is to bite the bullet... and give them your alibi now. Because no one is going to believe you later. That was five months ago. He tried to set me up for murder. Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds up. Good. Can I go home now? We have one of the victims who managed to escape. Want to know if you wouldn't mind sticking around and listening to her testimony? - Maybe it'll trigger something. - I'd like to help really but... We'd really appreciate it. - She's the only one who made it. - Okay. Amanda... in your own time... tell me the first thing you remember. I woke up. All I could taste was blood... and metal. Hello, Amanda. You don't know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Here's what happens if you lose. The device you're wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. When the timer at the back goes off... your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, I'll show you. There is only one key to open the device. It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around, Amanda. Know that I'm not lying. You better hurry up. Live or die. Make your choice. And then I saw the body. There was a knife. He'd been injected with an opiate overdose."

I don't know how I got here, I don't know how you got here. I just took the shots and went straight home to develop. Next thing I know, I'm chained to a pipe... in some pre-historic bathroom... staring at the guy I've been taking shots of all night. Clearly, whoever paid you to take pictures of me is the one who put us here. - Maybe. - What do you mean maybe? Of course it is. What did he look like? - He was just a guy. - Was he tall, skinny, obese, what? I don't take notes about his appearance. - You must remember something of him. - I can't. You don't remember a thing about the guy? - I told you... - For fuck's sake! I give up! He's a tall, black guy. He's got a scar around his neck, okay? Tapp! Det. Tapp. The guy who paid me to take these photos was not a cop. No. He was discharged from the police force. He broke down after his partner was killed. But that didn't stop him from harassing me. The guy became obsessed. He convinced himself I must have somehow been involved with the murders... And you helped him. You took money from him to invade my privacy. - How could you do that? - Call it my need to eat. Right. You know what? You're not a victim of this game... - you're a part of it. - Really? Obviously this cop thinks you're the one behind it all. I told you, he's not a cop. - He's a bottom feeder. Just like you. - What are you more pissed off about? That I took some shots of you... or that I took shots while you were cheating on your wife? - I did not cheat on her! - Why do you care what I think anyway? I don't give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter... and had a 15 hooker gang-bang. How did I get here? I had everything in order. My whole life was in perfect order. Sweetheart, are you okay? Mommy just needs you to be really strong right now. I'm not going to let anybody hurt you. You got that? That's my good girl. Hey, was there someone else at your house last night... - besides your wife and daughter? - No. Well, there's someone here. I know him. Zep! His name is Zep. He's an orderly in my hospital. You perverted little psychopath. I'm gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this!",
