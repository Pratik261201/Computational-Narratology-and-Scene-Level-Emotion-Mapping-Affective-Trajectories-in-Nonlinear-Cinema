      "raw_text": "Central Services We do the work, you do the pleasure Hi, there. I want to talk to you about ducts. Do your ducts seem old-fashioned... out-of-date? Central Services' new duct designs... are now available in hundreds of different colors... to suit your individual taste. Hurry now, while stocks last, to your nearest Central Services showroom. Designer colors to suit your demanding taste. We have here from the Ministry of Information... Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann. Good evening, David. What d'you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings? Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people... seems to have forgotten certain good old-fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game... they'd get a lot more out of life. Nevertheless, there are those who maintain... that the Ministry of Information has become too large and unwieldy. In free society, information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short. The cost of it all, seven percent of the gross national product. I understand this concern on behalf of the taxpayers. People want value for money. That is why we always insist... on the principle of Information Retrieval Charges. It's absolutely right and fair... that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention... and for the information retrieval procedures used in their interrogation. Do you believe the government is winning against terrorists? Oh, yes. We're fielding all their strokes, running all of them out... and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game. HELPMANN: Have to subsidize. Mr. Helpmann, the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year. Beginner's luck. Thank you very much, Deputy Minister. Thank you, David. And a very merry Christmas to you all. \"Scrooge was better than his word. \"He did it all, and infinitely more. \"And to Tiny Tim, who did not die... \"he became a second father. \"He became as good a friend, in the good old world. \"And so, as Tiny Tim observed... \"God bless us, everyone.\" Are you boys giving me the runaround? Now, I have to say, \"Hey, hey.\" Don't throw that. That's only for long distance. I'm sorry, we haven't any vacancies.",

I want to report a wrongful arrest. You want Information Adjustments. Different department. I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They said you have a form I need to fill out. - Have you got an arrest receipt? - Yeah. Is it stamped? Stamped? No, there's no stamp on it, you see. I can't let you have the form until this is stamped. Where do I get it stamped? Information Adjustments. It's nothing. It keeps picking up old films. That can't be right, can it?

Well, finish your tea, Sam. Thanks. I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted. - God, don't worry about that. - But if they did promote you... I've told you before. I'd turn it down. - Would you, really? - Really. You've been promoted. It's your mother, isn't it? Pulling strings again. Sam, it's time for you to grow up and accept responsibility. Your poor father would be appalled at your lack of promotion. Mother, I just wish you would stop interfering. I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am. No, you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you. He doesn't have your brains, but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition. Luckily, you've got me and the Deputy Minister. - Mr. Helpmann was very close to your father. - Now please, Mrs. Lowry. Don't get upset. Mr. Lowry, please wait in the reception. You're giving her wrinkles. - You see? - God! Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry. I'll make you 20 years younger. Dr. Jaffe, you are a genius. Would you like to be Surgeon General?",

Voila! Mr. Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was close to me. He still is. He'll take you under his wing when you get to Information Retrieval. You'll like it there. You're not listening to me, Mother. SECURITY GUARD: What the hell is this, lady? It's a present for my son. Really! I hope you like it. It's very exclusive. What on earth is it? Something for an executive. Madam Lowry! You look exquisite today. Merry Christmas. Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas. - You remember my son, Samuel? - Of course. We're joining Mrs. Terrain. Yes, they're waiting. - Mother, I thought we'd be able to talk. - We will. Ida! She's got what's-her-name with her. Well, Alma, how are you? You look wonderful. Hello, Shirley. Thank you, Spiro. - Salt? - Not yet. Sam, Happy Christmas. So sorry we're late. Thanks. Now, Alma... what are you going to have? I can't make up my mind whether to have the number one or the number two. What do you recommend, Spiro? Between you and me, madame... - today the number two. - Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have? Between you and me, mademoiselle, today the number one. Madam Lowry? To hell with the diet! I'm going to have a number eight, please. - A most perceptive choice, if I may say so. - Oh, Ida... - Monsieur? - Steak, please, rare. Mother... - Monsieur, quel numero? - I don't know which number. - Mother, please... - That one. There. Thanks. Mother, will you... Alma! You wicked girl. You've started your treatments. - Say the number, please. - You noticed. - You have to say the number! - Go away! I must tell you all about it. Number three. - Mother, will you listen to me? - Numero huit. Braised veal in wine sauce. It's too exciting. I've left Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman. MAITRE D': Numero deux, duck a I'orange. MOTHER: Chapman? MAITRE D': Excusez-moi. The acid man? Really, Ida. Just because his techniques are revolutionary. I don't go around calling Dr. Jaffe the knife man."

I'm sorry. - Do you remember Alison? - Good evening. Alison, Sam Lowry, an old friend. Alison, yes, of course. - You look different. - I'm two years older. And she's been to Dr. Jaffe. She doesn't like me telling people. But, in fact, she's really pleased. - I knew there was something different. - Remember how they used to stick out? What? Yes, well, rather. - I always used to wonder if they were real. - What, my ears? - Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back. - Yes, that's... I always wondered if she wore falsies. Mr. Helpmann. False ears. - Hello, Jack. - You remember my wife, Alison? Of course, Barbara, isn't it? How are you? Barbara's very well. How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Good. Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here. Have you got a minute? Would you excuse us? Of course. Come on, Alison... Barbara. Sam... I need your help. Thanks very much. Mr. Helpmann, I'm glad to be of help. And if I can help you...

I've decided I'd accept the transfer. If I'm not too late. Too late? That's for me to say. Well, then I am... Welcome to Information Retrieval. My name's Lowry. Sam Lowry. I've been told to report to Mr. Warrenn. Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected. - Don't you want to search me? - No, sir. - Want to see my ID? - No need, sir. - But I could be anybody. - No, you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval. The lift's arrived, sir. WARRENN: Half as terrorists, rest as victims. Definitely, no. My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn. Sam Lowry. Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay. Glad to have you on board.
