Dear Mr. Vernon... we accept the facf that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did was wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. What do you care? You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms and most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Correct? That's the way we saw each other at 7:00 this morning. We were brainwashed. I can't believe you can't get me out of this. I mean, it's so absurd I have to be here on a Saturday. - It's not like I'm a defective or anything. - I'll make it up to you. Honey, ditching class to go shopping doesn't make you a defective. Have a good day. Is this the first time or the last time we do this? Last. Well, get in there and use the time to your advantage. Mom, we're not supposed to study. We just have to sit there and do nothing. - Well, mister, you figure out a way to study. - Yeah. Well, go. Hey, I screwed around. Guys screw around. There's nothing wrong with that. Except you got caught, sport. Yeah, Mom already reamed me, all right? You want to miss a match? You want to blow your ride? Now, no school is gonna give a scholarship to a discipline case. Well, well. Here we are. I wanna congratulate you for being on time. Excuse me, sir. I think there's been a mistake. I know it's detention, but, I don't think I belong in here. It is now 7:06. You have exactly eight hours and 54 minutes to think about why you're here, to ponder the error of your ways. You may not talk. You will not move from these seats. And you... will not sleep. All right, people, we're gonna try something a little different today. We are going to write an essay... of no less than a thousand words... describing to me who you think you are. This a test? And when I say \"essay,\" I mean essay. I do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times. Is that clear, Mr. Bender? - Crystal. - Good. Maybe you'll learn a little something about yourself. Maybe you'll even decide whether or not you care to return. You know, I can answer that right now, sir. That'd be \"no\" for me, 'cause - - Sit down, Johnson.",

Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe? I'll give you the answer to that question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday. Don't mess with the bull, young man. You'll get the horns. That man is a brownie hound. You keep eatin' your hand, you're not gonna be hungry for lunch. I've seen you before, you know. Who I think I am. Who are you? Who are you? I am a walrus. It's the shits? I can't believe this is really happening to me. Oh, shit! What are we supposed to do if we have to take a piss? - Please. - If you gotta go, you gotta go. Oh, my God. - Hey, you're not urinating in here, man. - Don't talk. It makes it crawl back up. You whip it out and you're dead before the first drop hits the floor. You're pretty sexy when you get angry. Hey, homeboy, why don't you go close that door? We'll get the prom queen impregnated. Hey. Hey! What? If I lose my temper, you're totaled, man. Totally? Totally. Why don't you shut up? Nobody here is interested. Really. Butt face. Hey, sporto, what'd you do to get in here? Forget to wash your jock? Excuse me, fellas. I think we should just write our papers. Just because you live in here doesn't give you the right to be a pain in the ass. So knock it off! Well, it's a free country. He's just doing it to get a rise out of you. Just ignore him. Sweets? You couldn't ignore me if you tried. So... so... are you guys, like, boyfriend-girlfriend? Steady dates? Lovers? Come on, sporto. Level with me. Do you slip her the hot-beef injection? - Go to hell! - Enough! Hey! What's going on in there? Spoiled little pricks. Scumbag. What do you say we close that door? We can't have any kind of party with Vernon checking us out every few seconds. You know, the door's supposed to stay open. - So what? - So why don't you just shut up? - There's four other people in here, you know. - God, you can count. See, I knew you had to be smart to be a wrestler. - Who the hell are you to judge anybody anyway? - Really. You know, Bender, you don't even count. If you disappeared forever, it wouldn't make any difference. You may as well not even exist at this school. Well, I'll just run right out and join the wrestling team.",

No, I don't wear tights. I wear the required uniform. Tights. Shut up. You know, there's not supposed to be any, monkey business. Young man, have you finished your paper? Come on, Bender, don't screw around. - What are you gonna do? - Drop dead, I hope. All right! Bender, that's - that's school property there. I mean, that doesn't belong to us. It's something not to be toyed with. - That's very funny. Come on. Fix it. - You should really fix that. - Am I a genius? - No, you're an asshole. - What a funny guy. Everyone, just. - Fix the door, Bender! Listen. I've been here before. I know what I'm doing. - No! Fix the door! Get up there - - Shut up! Goddamn it! Why is that door closed? Why is that door closed? How are we supposed to know? We're not supposed to move. Right? Why? We're just sitting here, like we're supposed to. Who closed that door? - I think a screw fell out of it. - It just closed, sir. Who? She doesn't talk, sir. - Give me that screw. - I don't have it. You want me to yank you out of that seat and shake it out of you? I don't have it. Screws fall out all the time. The world's an imperfect place. Give it to me, Bender. Excuse me, sir. Why would anybody want to steal a screw? Watch it, young lady. The door's way too heavy, sir. Damn it! Chair's - Son of a bitch! Andrew Clark, get up here. Front and center. Let's go. - Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up? - That's right. If he gets up, we'll all get up. It'll be anarchy! - Okay, watch - watch the magazines. - It's out of my hands. That's very clever, sir. But what if there's a fire? I think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir. All right, what are you doing with this? Get this out of here, for God's sake. What's the matter with you? Come on. The school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library. Show Dick some respect. Let's go. Go. Get back in your seat. I expected a little more from a varsity letterman. You're not fooling anybody, Bender. The next screw that falls out is gonna be you.

        "Ah, you'd never miss it. You don't have any goals. - Oh, but I do. - Yeah? I want to be just like you. I figure all I need's a lobotomy and some tights. You wear tights? No, I don't wear tights. I wear the required uniform. Tights. Shut up. You know, there's not supposed to be any, monkey business. Young man, have you finished your paper? Come on, Bender, don't screw around. - What are you gonna do? - Drop dead, I hope. All right! Bender, that's - that's school property there. I mean, that doesn't belong to us. It's something not to be toyed with. - That's very funny. Come on. Fix it. - You should really fix that. - Am I a genius? - No, you're an asshole. - What a funny guy. Everyone, just. - Fix the door, Bender! Listen. I've been here before. I know what I'm doing. - No! Fix the door! Get up there - - Shut up! Goddamn it! Why is that door closed? Why is that door closed? How are we supposed to know? We're not supposed to move. Right? Why? We're just sitting here, like we're supposed to. Who closed that door? - I think a screw fell out of it. - It just closed, sir. Who? She doesn't talk, sir. - Give me that screw. - I don't have it. You want me to yank you out of that seat and shake it out of you? I don't have it. Screws fall out all the time. The world's an imperfect place. Give it to me, Bender. Excuse me, sir. Why would anybody want to steal a screw? Watch it, young lady. The door's way too heavy, sir. Damn it! Chair's - Son of a bitch! Andrew Clark, get up here. Front and center. Let's go. - Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up? - That's right. If he gets up, we'll all get up. It'll be anarchy! - Okay, watch - watch the magazines. - It's out of my hands. That's very clever, sir. But what if there's a fire? I think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir. All right, what are you doing with this? Get this out of here, for God's sake. What's the matter with you? Come on. The school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library. Show Dick some respect. Let's go. Go. Get back in your seat. I expected a little more from a varsity letterman. You're not fooling anybody, Bender. The next screw that falls out is gonna be you. Eat my shorts. What was that? Eat... my... shorts."

I'm a winner because I've got strength and speed, kinda like a racehorse. That's about how involved I am in what's happening to me. Yeah? That's very interesting. Now why don't you tell me why you're really in here? Forget it. Claire, you want to see a picture of a guy with elephantiasis of the nuts? - It's pretty tasty. - No, thank you. How do you think he rides a bike? Oh, Claire? Would you ever consider dating a guy like this? Can't you just leave me alone? I mean, if he had a great personality, was a good dancer and had a cool car? Although you'd probably have to ride in the back seat, because his nuts would ride shotgun. - You know what I wish I was doing? - Ah. Watch what you say. - Brian here is a cherry. - A cherry? I wish I was on a plane to France. - I'm not a cherry. - When have you ever gotten laid? I've laid lots of times. Name one. She lives in Canada. Met her at Niagara Falls. - You wouldn't know her. - Ever laid anyone around here? Oh. You and Claire did it? - What are you talking about? - Nothing. Nothing. - Let's just drop it. We'll talk about it later. - Drop what? What are you talking about? Brian's trying to tell me that in addition to the number of girls in the Niagara Falls area, that presently you and he are riding the hobby horse. Little pig. No, I'm not. John said I was a cherry and I said I wasn't. That's all that was said. Well, then what were you motioning to Claire for? I don't appreciate this very much, Brian. - He is lying. - Oh, you weren't motioning to Claire? - You know he's lying, right? - Were you or were you not motioning to Claire? Yeah, but it was only - it was only because I didn't want her to know I was a virgin, okay? Excuse me for being a virgin. I'm sorry. Why didn't you want me to know you were a virgin? Because it's personal business. It's my personal, private business. Well, Brian, it doesn't sound like you're doing any business. I think it's okay for a guy to be a virgin. You do? - What's in there? - Guess. Where's your lunch?",

If you say you have, you're a slut. It's a trap. You want to, but you can't. And when you do, you wish you didn't, right? - Wrong. - Or are you a tease? - She's a tease. - I'm sure. Why don't you just forget it? Oh, you're a tease and you know it. All girls are teases. She's only a tease if what she does gets you hot. I don't do anything! That's why you're a tease. - Okay, let me ask you a few questions. - I already told you everything. No, doesn't it bother you to sleep around without being in love? Don't you want any respect? I don't screw to get respect. That's a difference between you and me. - It's not the only difference, I hope. - Face it. - You're a tease. - I'm not a tease. Sure, you are. Sex is your weapon. You said it yourself. You use it to get respect. No, I never said that. She twisted my words around. - What do you use if for then? - I don't use it, period!

You're there with all the sports. I know exactly what you'd do. You'd say hi to him, and when he left, you'd cut him all up so your friends wouldn't think that you really liked him. No way. Okay.

You know, I have just as many feelings as you do, and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them. God, you're so pathetic. Don't you ever, ever compare yourself to me. Okay? You got everything, and I got shit. Fucking Rapunzel, right? School would probably fuckin' shut down if you didn't show up. Queenie isn't here. I like those earrings, Claire. - Shut up. - Are those real diamonds, Claire? - Shut up. - I bet they are. Did you work for the money for those earrings? Shut your mouth. - Or did Daddy buy those for you? - Shut up! I bet he bought those for you. I bet those were a Christmas gift, right? You know what I got for Christmas this year? It was a banner fuckin' year at the old Bender family. I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me, said, \"Hey, smoke up, Johnny. \" Okay, so go home and cry to your daddy. Don't cry here, okay? My God, are we gonna be like our parents? Not me. Ever. It's unavoidable. Just happens. What happens? When you grow up... your heart dies. Who cares? I care. I was just thinking, I mean... I know it's kind of a weird time, but I was just wondering,... what is gonna happen to us on Monday when we're all together again? I mean, I consider you guys my friends. I'm not wrong, am I? No. So on Monday, what happens? Are we still friends, you mean? - If we're friends now, that is? - Yeah. - Do you want the truth? - Yeah, I want the truth. I don't think so. With all of us or just John? With all of you. - That's a real nice attitude, Claire. - Oh, be honest, Andy. If Brian came walking up to you in the hall on Monday, what would you do? I mean, picture this. You're there with all the sports. I know exactly what you'd do. You'd say hi to him, and when he left, you'd cut him all up so your friends wouldn't think that you really liked him. No way. Okay. What if I came up to you? The same exact thing. You are a bitch! Why? 'Cause I'm telling the truth?"
