She's fantastic. What are you talking about? I think she sings funny. And her dancing's not all that great either. That's the first time she did it, okay? Yeah, but I had all the kits by then. Because she didn't take the kettle, so I was stuck. Do you want me to take the kettle, Samuel? No, I don't. I just want Kathy to put it over here. This is, you know... If you say these words, and then, boom, you just put your hands out, and there they are. They're there. Please don't drop the props, Kathy. Wait, wait. Why are you putting it on her head, though? I'm a little confused. I don't know. It was, uh... Because she's not going to pick it up. It looks like you're trying to... put a hat on her head or something. You're fantastic. You just have to listen to your heart, Cvalda. I don't want you to call me Cvalda. Okay, Paul, please. You're Cvalda to me. Let's do some sound effects. Wait! I told you no tapping in \"The Sound of Music.\" It really needs rhythm. Like drums or something. Everybody's doing a great job. Really. \"L-T-U...\" Oh, hello, Selma. Come here. - Are you ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. Okay, you know where to stand. Yeah. So let's try this one. \"F-E-Z-T.\" Maybe even this one. \"T-E-F-P-O...\" I think you can work that machine safely. I'll write a note to the plant and let them know. Thank you. Bye. Goodbye. Bye. Goodbye. We lost five hours 'cause some idiot broke the machine. Bill's here. So? Well, he's here with Gene. Oh, that sounds like bad news. What are you going to do? Well, I guess I got to tell her, don't i? You can't bring the script to work, Selma. Keep your eyes on the machine, okay? Yeah. Sure. Bill's here. Bill? He's here with Gene. Not again! You got to come right back, okay? Don't be too worried. We're gonna work this out. Here she comes. Why are you not in school?! Uhh... When I say so, you go to school! Do you think I joke? You have to study! Come on, Selma, stop. We talked about this. Didn't we talk about it? Hanging out with those automobile thieves. So what? He's learning. Selma, he's learning. Aw, come on. Gene, this is the most important thing. You have to go to school.",

Yeah, I'm sure of it. This is my punishment, that you help me with this. And you've got... You've got to make your bed as well. And you forgot to wrap up the bread. Two times. There's no more of that. You keep reading. \"So long, farewell, auf... wiedersehen... adieu, adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu.\" \"To yieu... and yieu...\" What does that mean, \"yieu\"? It's your dumb musical. \"And yieu...\" It's German. - You think? - Mm. You want some more ketchup? No. Are you tired? Why--why should you... always ask me so... so stupid questions? Shall I show you my step? Oh, hi. Hi, Gene. How's the dancing? Oh... good. - Yeah? - Yeah, Yeah. You want to come over to me and Bill's place and listen to some music? That--that would be lovely. But... we couldn't. Come on. Come on. Yeah... uh... Let's go. Come on. You should ask Bill about his money. Linda likes it when we talk about that. You're doing a very nice job with these. How about that? You have to be very careful not to bend the card. Uh-huh. Otherwise I don't get paid for it. No. That's fair, because... the people in the shops would never want to buy it if it's bent. You wouldn't buy it if it was bent. That's true, I wouldn't. Wouldn't buy anything if it was bent. In Czechoslovakia, I saw a film, and they were eating candy from a tin just like this. No. I thought to myself... how wonderful it must be in the United States. Yeah? You think my house looks like a movie? Oh, our house looks like a movie. And you look like a movie star. Bill gives me a lot of money. You know? I know. Of course, it's all that money you inherited, isn't it, Bill? That's right. Hey, Selma... Take the rest with you. Are you sure? Go on. Hello. Good morning. I've got the rent. Oh.

She doesn't see that well. I paid good money to see this film. Well, so did she. I love it when they dance. For Pete's sake, it's a musical. Of course they're dancing! We know that! Oh, you're so smart. - Yes. - Oh. I think you made friends, Kathy. Stop! So, what'd she say? What? What did she say? She didn't say anything. Are you trying to tell me something? It's about the bike.

He doesn't know anything, Selma. Frankly. Why, have I done something? No. I haven't got the money. But... I'm almost the only kid in class who doesn't have a bike. I even know a boy who's got a scooter. You know I haven't got any money. The only extra money I got the times I managed to save up, I send it... to Grandpa. - Come have a look. - I'm not gonna get you expensive things. Your mother is only teasing. Look what she's brought for you! It's a bike! We cannot accept that. Selma, it was second-hand. I can't give him any expensive things. - Yeah, but-- - I can't even give it for his birthday. - Yeah, but, well-- - He's just gonna accept that. I'm not that sort of mom. I'm--I'm-- I'm just not that kind of mother, Gene. I... Can't you be that kind of a mother? It's not exactly a scooter. Hmm... We'll see. We'll see. Careful! Don't ride too fast. Hey, gene, bring it over here. He looks very happy, doesn't he? He does look happy. Here he comes again. Attention! Bring it over here. Mom... Okay.

You... you mustn't tell him, because then it could get worse. I just have to save up money, you know, enough money to... Oh, I almost got it. To, uh... For the operation. They can operate on Gene when he turns 1 3. And you made up that story about your father? Huh. I never had a father. I made up his name, too. And that's why you put in all these hours and do all these pins and do everything you do. For him. For his operation. Well, it is my fault. I guess... How is it your fault? Because l... I knew he would... he would have bad eyes like me. But I had him... all the same. You're very strong. I'm not strong. I've got little games I play when it goes really hard.

I just love the musicals. Oh, when they're all tap dancing? All of them tap dancing, all of them, this huge, long line. I... wouldn't you like to be in that big, long line? Yeah.

The last thing on the list is the bake sale. Two sundays away. Hi, Selma. Come on in, come on in. I'm gonna introduce you to your understudy. My understudy? Yeah. This girl Suzan, who boris knows, is a good singer. She's a good dancer. She'll learn your part, too, because, say, you get a cold, and... you can't do it, then the show doesn't have to stop. Okay? Suzan, Selma. Selma, Suzan. Could you take off your glasses? I think we'll do the part without glasses. Next sunday, you will see both Marias. I mean, Selma will do the role, really, but... i'll have you read part of it too. All right? It's your first time on the night shift, right? While this is being pressed, you'll be cutting on the other machine. That means you'll be in charge of two machines. You have to beat Sarah over there, right? This pallet must never be empty. Is it always so dark in here? What? Is it always so dark in here? It's exactly the same as the daytime. Oh. Okay. The only thing is you have to work a little faster. That's what you're paid for, right? - Okay. - Okay? Thank you. - Excuse me. - Yeah? You have to work a little, you know, a little faster than this. Okay. What are you doing here? What do you think? I didn't put you down for the night shift, Kathy. Run along, Norman. I'm on my own time now. How I spend it is my own business. 'Night, ladies! Good night! Faster. A little faster. I like it better when you dance. You should dance more... Cvalda. I will dance when there is music. It's music. Now dance. Selma! Stop that, you've cut yourself! Get away from the machine! Henry! Oh, Jeff is here. Hello, Jeff. Hi, Kathy. Do you live here? Thought she might say yes to a ride when it's this late. M-maybe Kathy... wants a ride. No, it's all right. What's that, with your hand? She cut her... Cut my finger. Yeah. It's going to be all right. The plates are sharp. Goodnight. Careful. I think I found a solution to our problem. That makes me really happy. It's nothing special... But I've made up my mind. I'm gonna tell Linda, and, uh... I mean, after all, she loves me, and... We'll just work it out together. That sounds like a really good idea, Bill."

Get up there! Go on to Miller's farm! If you want the money... you're gonna have to kill me. Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me. I'm not letting go. No. Selma, shoot me! Just shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me!! Cant't you just stand up and pull the goddamn trigger! I'll have to take the money. Forgive me. Selma? Jeff. What are you doing here? Is it already 3:00? Uh, not really. Hell, I'm always early. You cut yourself again. There's some blood on your blouse. Strange. I couldn't feel it at all. Selma... We're here now. By the bus stop? Yeah, the bus stop. It's over there. And the lake is here? Promise me that you won't follow me. Promise. Yeah, I promise. Dobry Vecer, Pane Doktore."
