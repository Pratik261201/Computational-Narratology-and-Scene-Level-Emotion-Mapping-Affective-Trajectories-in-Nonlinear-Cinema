My father before me was a woodcutter... ...only he's dead now. My mother, too. My sister's own husband... All of them dead. If only I could find work... I beg you, Your Worship. Bread to eat, that's all. Just to eat... to live. Remove the prisoner!(BANGS GAVEL) Please! Please, I'm begging you. No! No, let me go! Please, you don't understand. SISTER: Jean! Please... No! No!

No, not bread. No... Oh, no... You don't kill for bread. Agh! Hey! Oh! Help! We should do something. What for? He'll fall, that's all, and be killed. Help! Help! Oh! Let me try. Go ahead.

I want you to put clean sheets upon the bed in the alcove. You mean, to sleep here? Yes. I think he could do with a good night's rest, hm? Monsieur, I beg you to consider... See to it at once. Well, my friend, perhaps you will wish to wash before supper? I can't pay for any of this. I have no money. And I would not take it if you did. You're more at home here than myself and all there is here is yours. But you... you don't even know who I am. Ah, but I do. You are my brother... ...and I can tell that you have suffered greatly. Even for a priest, you are different from the others. But... there are many more of them than there are of you. No man who is created good by God can be made entirely bad by man. There is always a spark... ...which evil can never extinguish. I don't know anything about that. I eat to live, that's all. It's enough for now.

He is a bishop. May we enter, Monseigneur? Indeed. I have been waiting for you. Come in. What a pleasant surprise! I am so happy to see you again, Monsieur. What's that? You have discovered, of course, that you forgot the candlesticks. Candlesticks? They are also silver and I think they should fetch you 200 francs at least. Why didn't you take them with you? I... Monseigneur, are you saying this man spoke the truth? We thought he was running away, but he claimed... Yes, I know. He told you that, ah, this silver had been given to him by a good priest. And so it was. You were mistaken. In that case, sir, we shall release him. Immediately. I know you gentlemen try to do your duty and I do not blame you... ...but you may retire now. Good day. You... Is it true? I'm free? Here. You will take these with you. No, I can't. Take them! Good. Now you will leave in peace. Father... Promise me. Promise that you will employ the money from this silver... ...in becoming an honest man. Do you hear me? And I promise you... ...that there is more joy in heaven over the face of a repentant sinner... ...than the white silk robes of a hundred just men. If you leave here with thoughts of hatred against your fellow man... ...then you're worthy of pity. But if you leave with thoughts of kindness and peace... ...oh, then you... ...you are more worthy than any of us. (SOBS) Go, my brother. For you no longer belong to evil. I've bought your soul. And I withdraw from it all black thoughts... ...and I give it to God. (FOLK MUSIC) (CHILDREN CHEERING AND LAUGHING) Who is that with Troufiat? It's the new police inspector. Another?

The law does not allow for special days. A crime that is committed must be punished. Indeed, sir, we shall have to institute some changes when I take over. We have very little crime here, Inspector. It is a prosperous town. For that we can thank our good mayor Monsieur Madeline. You see? On the platform there. A truly wonderful man. I've seen enough here. Let's go. As you wish, Inspector. (GROWLING) (CHEERING) Hey, François, do you want a girl? You can have her cheap. You think I'm crazy? Put her in a kennel. Away with you! Yes. Is there anything else? Yes, you have a visitor to see you. Yes? He is the new inspector of police and he would like to introduce himself. Hm. Very well. Have him come in. You may come in, sir. Inspector Javert at your service, sir. How do you do? My privilege to serve you, Monsieur Le maire. I am your new inspector of police and I trust you never find me failing in my duty. Er... ...where have you served before this? I have been 21 years at Toulon prison. I became chief of the guards there. Well, I... We welcome you, Inspector. Is it possible, Monsieur... Have we met before? No. No? You have never been in Toulon? Never. And might I inquire when you may be free to inspect my men at headquarters? Inspect your men? In two short weeks, I have brought a new discipline to the department. We would be honored by a visit at your earliest convenience. Tomorrow perhaps? Oh, I am busy tomorrow. Friday? Very well, then. Thank you, sir. I will not take up any more of your time. Beads... Sir? You make beads here, I understand. Yes. Beads. How long has this man been mayor? Three years. Has he a family? No, he lives alone. That is, he has a housekeeper. Sister Simplice. A plain woman, but well known here because she never tells a lie! He attends no social events? Only in his duty as mayor. He keeps to himself. How long has he lived here? Five years. Where did he come from? I don't know, but we're all grateful he arrived. He brought with him this idea of using gum lac instead of rosin to make beads. It's so much cheaper that you can make twice as many at the same price.",

The law does not allow for special days. A crime that is committed must be punished. Indeed, sir, we shall have to institute some changes when I take over. We have very little crime here, Inspector. It is a prosperous town. For that we can thank our good mayor Monsieur Madeline. You see? On the platform there. A truly wonderful man. I've seen enough here. Let's go. As you wish, Inspector.   Hey, François, do you want a girl? You can have her cheap. You think I'm crazy? Put her in a kennel. Away with you! Yes. Is there anything else? Yes, you have a visitor to see you. Yes? He is the new inspector of police and he would like to introduce himself. Hm. Very well. Have him come in. You may come in, sir. Inspector Javert at your service, sir. How do you do? My privilege to serve you, Monsieur Le maire. I am your new inspector of police and I trust you never find me failing in my duty. Er... ...where have you served before this? I have been 21 years at Toulon prison. I became chief of the guards there. Well, I... We welcome you, Inspector. Is it possible, Monsieur... Have we met before? No. No? You have never been in Toulon? Never. And might I inquire when you may be free to inspect my men at headquarters? Inspect your men? In two short weeks, I have brought a new discipline to the department. We would be honored by a visit at your earliest convenience. Tomorrow perhaps? Oh, I am busy tomorrow. Friday? Very well, then. Thank you, sir. I will not take up any more of your time. Beads... Sir? You make beads here, I understand. Yes. Beads. How long has this man been mayor? Three years. Has he a family? No, he lives alone. That is, he has a housekeeper. Sister Simplice. A plain woman, but well known here because she never tells a lie! He attends no social events? Only in his duty as mayor. He keeps to himself. How long has he lived here? Five years. Where did he come from? I don't know, but we're all grateful he arrived. He brought with him this idea of using gum lac instead of rosin to make beads. It's so much cheaper that you can make twice as many at the same price."

I'd do the work for nothing... ...ah, just to stay here, with my little one, of course. I'll speak to the Mother Prioress, but, ah, I don't know what I'm going to tell her.

I thought I told you to stay away! Down with the Bourbons. I fight like anyone else. Quickly! We have a spy! A spy? Yes. I've seen him before. He even told me who he was. Who are you, Monsieur? What is your name? Javert. He is Javert. Who is Javert? The chief inspector of the quartier Mouffetard. Well, Monsieur I'inspecteur... I have the honour of telling you you will be shot just before the barricade is taken. Why not at once? We have to save our gunpowder. Your time will come, as it will for all of us. (SCREAMING) Gavroche, take this letter to 16 rue de Talliard. It's urgent! But... I know you want to die with us... ...but your death won't save the Republic. Live to fight in other ways. Now go! (KNOCK AT DOOR) Come in. Come in. Come in, come in. What is it? Er... ...I have a message for Cosette. Oh, for Cosette. Well, I'm her father. You can give it to me.

Where is he now, this Marius? On the rue St Denis, at the barricade. They are fighting. Now? I go back to join them. You? That's ridiculous. Long live the Republic! (GUNFIRE) (NEIGHING) Agh! Fire! Agh! Charge! He can't make it. They'll kill him! Gavroche! Get back! Get back! It's no use. They'll kill you, too! No! Don't shoot! He's a loyalist. Do you know him? His name is Monsieur Madeline. I'll vouch for him. MAN: Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Why have you come here? I came to take your place. It's a fool's errand. I couldn't leave if I wanted to. Unless you surrender. It's out of the question. If all we can offer them are our corpses, we'll do it, but you've walked into a trap. They've seen you join us. You're one of us now. (GUNFIRE) I should have known. The scoundrel joins up with the fools. How did you come... I'm a troublesome spy. You needn't be concerned. They will blow out my brains shortly. And you, I suppose, will be certain to watch. You are welcome to. How much longer can you hold? We will not survive the next attack. I want to ask a favour of you. Well? Let me be the one... to kill the spy.",
