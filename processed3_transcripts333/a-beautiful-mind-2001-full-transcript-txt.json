MAN 1: Yeah, he's wasted on math. MAN 2: He should be running for president. There could be a mathematical explanation for how bad your tie is. (LAUGHS) NEILSON: Thank you.

MARTIN: Ah! Bender. BENDER: Nice to see you. NEILSON: Congratulations, Mr Hansen. MARTIN: Thank you. I'll take another. Excuse me? MARTIN: A thousand pardons. I simply assumed you were the waiter. - SOL: Play nice, Hansen. - Nice is not Hansen's strong suit. MARTIN: An honest mistake. Well, Martin Hansen. It is Martin, isn't it? Why, yes, John, it is. I imagine you're getting quite used to miscalculation. I've read your preprints, both of them. The one on Nazi ciphers and the other one on nonlinear equations. And I am supremely confident that there is not a single seminal or innovative idea in either one of them. Enjoy your punch. (SNICKERS) Gentlemen, meet John Nash, the mysterious West Virginia genius.

Despite my privileged upbringing, I'm actually quite well-balanced. I have a chip on both shoulders. (CHUCKLES) Maybe you're just better with the old integers than you are with people. My first grade teacher, she told me that I was born with two helpings of brain but only half a helping of heart. (CHUCKLES) CHARLES: Wow! She sounds lovely! The truth is that I don't like people much. And they don't much like me. But why, with all your obvious wit and charm? (LAUGHS) Seriously, John. Mathematics. Mathematics is never going to lead you to a higher truth. And you know why? Because it's boring. It's really boring. You know, half these schoolboys are already published? I cannot waste time with these classes and these books. (COUGHS) Memorising the weak assumptions of lesser mortals! (CHUCKLES) I need to look through to the governing dynamics. Find a truly original idea. That's the only way I'll ever distinguish myself. - It's the only way that I'll ever... - Matter. Yes. MARTIN: All right, who's next?

It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid it's just not nearly good enough. - May I? - Thank you. I've been working on manifold embedding. My bargaining stratagems are starting to show some promise. If you could just arrange another meeting, if you would be kind enough, with Professor Einstein. - I've repeatedly asked you for that, sir. - Now, John... I'd be able to show him my revisions on his... John. Do you see what they're doing in there? Congratulations, Professor. MAX: Thank you, sir. Thank you. It's the pens. Reserved for a member of the department that makes the achievement of a lifetime. Now what do you see, John? Recognition. Well done, Professor. Well done. Well, try seeing accomplishment. Is there a difference? John, you haven't focused. I'm sorry, but up to this point, your record doesn't warrant any placement at all. Good day. PROFESSOR: And my compliments to you, sir. MAX: Thank you so much.  JOHN: I can't see it."

        "D.H. bloody Lawrence. I really do think you should buy yourself a new book.  Well, I've been reading a lot about you. How are you, John? At first, all my work here was trivial, but a new assignment came up and... I can't really tell you any details. Top secret? Black bag? Black ops? Something like that. - And... - Yes? Well, I met a girl. - No! A human girl? - Homo sapien. - A biped? - Yep. And contrary to all probabilities, she finds me attractive on a number of different levels. God, that's wonderful. Well, there's no accounting for taste, is there? - Should I marry her? - Oh, God. Right. I mean, everything's going well. The job is fine. I have enough money. It all seems to add up. But how do you know for sure? Nothing's ever for sure, John. That's the only sure thing I do know. Good evening. Alicia, please don't be angry. I just lost track of time at work, - again. - Mmm-hmm. I'm sorry. I didn't have time to wrap it. Happy birthday. The refractive faces of the glass, you see, they create a full wavelength dispersal, - so if you look inside it, you can see... - Every possible colour. Every possible colour. Yeah. Remember you said that time, \"God must be a painter \"because of all the colours\"? At the governor's house, you said that. I didn't think you were listening. I was listening. It's beautiful.  Alicia, does our relationship warrant long-term commitment? Because I need some kind of proof, some kind of verifiable, empirical data.  I'm sorry, just give me a moment to redefine my girlish notions of romance. A proof? Verifiable data. Okay. Well, how big is the universe? Infinite. How do you know? I know because all the data indicates it's infinite. - But it hasn't been proven yet? - No. - You haven't seen it. - No. How do you know for sure? I don't, I just believe it. It's the same with love, I guess. Now, the part that you don't know is if I want to marry you.   Smile for the camera! Well done! Congratulations. You look beautiful. Hi, how are you? - Bye-bye. - Bye, now. - Bye! - Bye! Be safe!  Get in. Hurry. They're following us. Who is... Who is following us? The drop has been compromised. Get down! Stay down.    - Here, take this."

I never would have considered that. Have I just reached some level of honesty that borders on stupidity?  No, you haven't. Because I wouldn't have thought of that. Shall we have tea? I don't go in there. I usually just take my sandwich in the library. Come on, John. Let's have some tea. It's a big day. Most commercially available brands of tea are not suitable to my palate, you see."

(SNIFFS) I would have thought the nominations for the Nobel Prize would've been secret. I would have thought you'd only find out if you won or lost. That is generally the case, yes, but these are special circumstances. The awards are substantial. They require private funding. As such, the image of the Nobel is... I see. So, you came here to find out if I was crazy? Find out if I would screw everything up if I actually won? Dance around the podium, strip naked and squawk like a chicken, things of this nature? Something like that, yes. Would I embarrass you? Yes, it is possible. You see, I am crazy. I take the newer medications, but I still see things that are not here. I just choose not to acknowledge them. Like a diet of the mind, I choose not to indulge certain appetites. Like my appetite for patterns. Perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream. MAN: Professor Nash. It's good to have you here, John. Thank you. It's an honour, sir. Thank you very much. A privilege, Professor. Professor. - Nicely done, John. - Thank you, Tom. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Ed. That was certainly most unexpected. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. I've always believed in numbers, in the equations and logics that lead to reason. But after a lifetime of such pursuits, I ask, what truly is logic? Who decides reason? My quest has taken me through the physical, the metaphysical, the delusional and back. And I have made the most important discovery of my career. The most important discovery of my life. It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found. I'm only here tonight because of you. You are the reason I am. You are all my reasons. Thank you. JOHN: So nice to have met you. I'll call for the car, Dad. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Are you ready to go now? - Yes, I am. Yes, indeed, and yes, please. Thank you so much. Thank you. What is it? What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing at all. - Come with me, young lady. - Oh. I have a car outside. Are you interested in a ride?\n\nWhere's it going to?",
