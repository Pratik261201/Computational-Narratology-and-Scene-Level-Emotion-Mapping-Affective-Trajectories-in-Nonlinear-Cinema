I'm stabilizing Ronson. We don't have the time. I have to stop the bleeding! Leave him! Have you got him? He's in the black Audi. What about Ronson? He's been hit. We're sending an emergency evacuation squad. They'll be too bloody late! He's seen us. Medical evac for Ronson five minutes away. That's all right. You weren't using it. I wasn't using that one, either. Keep your head down. Just get clear! Tanner, which way? Keep going. I can direct you from here. You both know what's at stake here. We can't afford to lose that list. Yes, ma'am. Where are they now? They appear to be on the rooftops of the Grand Bazaar. Take a left. There's a bridge. You can cut him off. Down, sir! - What happened? - They're on the train, ma'am. What do you mean on the train? I mean, they're on top of a train. Well, get after them, for God's sake! She's going out of range. We've lost tracking. We're blind here. - What's going on? - I'm still with them. Get me CCTV, satellite, anything! What was that? VW Beetles. I think. Bond! He's uncoupling the cars. 007, are you all right? Just changing carriages. What's going on? Report! It's rather hard to explain, ma'am. 007's still in pursuit. Looks like there isn't much more road. I don't think I can go any further. I may have a shot. It's not clean. Repeat, I do not have a clean shot. There's a tunnel ahead. I'm gonna lose them. Can you get into a better position? Negative. There's no time. Take the shot. I said take the shot. I can't! I may hit Bond. Take the bloody shot! Agent down. This is the end Hold your breath and count to ten Feel the earth move and then Hear my heart burst again For this is the end I've drowned and dreamt this moment So overdue, I owe them Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall And face it all together At skyfall Skyfall is where we start A thousand miles and poles apart Where worlds collide and days are dark You may have my number You can take my name But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall And face it all together Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall And face it all together at skyfall Where you go I go What you see I see I know I'd never be me without the security of your loving arms keeping me from harm Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall And face it all together Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall And face it all together At Skyfall Let the sky fall We will stand tall at skyfall It's like being summoned to the headmaster's study.",

I have to be frank with you. I think that would be a good idea. The Prime Minister's concerned. Well, you can tell him my operatives are pursuing every avenue. Have you considered pulling out the agents? I've considered every option. Forgive me, that sounds like an evasion. Forgive me, but why am I here? Three months ago, you lost the computer drive containing the identity of almost every NATO agent embedded in terrorist organizations across the globe. A list which, in the eyes of our allies, never existed. So if you'll forgive me, I think you know why you're here. Are we to call this \"civilian oversight\"? No, we're to call this \"retirement planning.\" Your country has only the highest respect for you and your many years of service. When your current posting is completed, you'll be awarded GCMG with full honors. Congratulations. You're firing me. No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee the transition period leading to your voluntary retirement in two months' time. Your successor has yet to be appointed, so we'll be asking you... I'm not an idiot, Mallory. I know I can't do this job forever but I'll be damned if I'm going to leave the department in worse shape than I found it. M, you've had a great run. You should leave with dignity. Oh, to hell with dignity. I'll leave when the job's done. Yes? Now? Ma'am, alert from Q-Branch. Someone's trying to decrypt the stolen hard drive. We're tracing the encryption signal. Localizing now. Centering in the UK. London. Get us back to base as soon as possible. It's coming from Ml6. What? The data packet is linking to our network. Correction. This is behind our firewall. We should shut down. No, track it. We have to know where it's coming from. Strip the headers. Trace the source. How the hell did they get into our system? Getting trace back now. It appears... It appears to be your computer, ma'am. Shut it down. What is this? For God's sake! Just get out of the way! - Don't you recognize the car? - Madam. Oh... ! This is CNN Breaking News. Emergency crews are still attempting to assess the damage as investigators hunt for leads in what now appears to be a major terrorist attack in the heart of London.",

Ronson didn't make it, did he? No. So this is it. We're both played out. Well, if you believe that, why did you come back? Good question. Because we're under attack. And you know we need you. Well, I'm here. You'll have to be debriefed and declared fit for active service. You can only return to duty when you've passed the tests, so take them seriously. And a shower might be in order. I'll go home and change. Oh, we've sold your flat, put your things into storage. Standard procedure on the death of an unmarried employee with no next of kin. You should have called. I'll find a hotel. Well, you're bloody well not sleeping here. The assailant hacked into the environmental control system, locked out the safety protocols and turned on the gas, all of which should have been impossible. On top of that, they hacked into her files. They knew her appointments, knew she'd be out of the building. They weren't targeting her. They wanted her to see it. Where are we, Tanner? New digs. The old building was declared \"strategically vulnerable\". That's putting it mildly. He was able to breach the most secure computer system in Britain. So we're on war footing now. This was part of Churchill's bunker. We're still discovering tunnels dating back to the 18th Century.",

The new Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee. Charming man. I think you and he are really going to hit it off. Welcome to the new MI6. We've attempted to trace the computer message, but it was sent by an asymmetrical security algorithm, which bounced the signal all over the globe through over a thousand different servers. And now that they've accessed M's codes, it's only a matter of time before they're able to decrypt the list. Q-Branch have been analyzing the picture but so far nothing. The general feeling is it's probably someone from her past. Perhaps when she was running things in Hong Kong. She's no idea what it all means. You believe that? The truth is, we don't have a clue who took the list or what they plan to do with it. We can always do this later. You know what? Let's. I'd like to start with some simple word associations. Just tell me the first word that pops into your head. For example, I might say \"Day\" and you might say... Wasted. All right. Gun. - Shot. - Agent. Provocateur. Woman. Provocatrix. Heart. Target. Bird. Sky. M. Bitch. Sunlight. Swim. - Moonlight. - Dance. Murder. Employment. - Country. - England. Skyfall. Skyfall. Done. Well, this is going well. Get these analyzed. For her eyes only. She's ready for you. I'm sorry, have we met before? I'm the one who should say \"sorry\". It was only four ribs. Some of the less vital organs. Nothing major. Not enough excitement in Istanbul? I've been reassigned. Temporary suspension from field work. - Really? - Mmm. Something to do with killing 007. Well, you gave it your best shot. That was hardly my best shot. I'm not sure I could survive your best. I doubt you'll get the chance. Well, do me a favor, will you? If they do ever let you back out there, warn me first. I'm assisting Gareth Mallory in the transition, and then I'll be back in the field. That's what you want? Yes, of course. It's not for everyone. Ah, 007. It's this way. In your defense, a moving target is much harder to hit. Then you better keep moving. The whole office goes up in smoke and that bloody thing survives. Your interior decorating tips have always been appreciated, 007.",

We've attempted to trace the computer message, but it was sent by an asymmetrical security algorithm, which bounced the signal all over the globe through over a thousand different servers. And now that they've accessed M's codes, it's only a matter of time before they're able to decrypt the list. Q-Branch have been analyzing the picture but so far nothing. The general feeling is it's probably someone from her past. Perhaps when she was running things in Hong Kong. She's no idea what it all means. You believe that? The truth is, we don't have a clue who took the list or what they plan to do with it. We can always do this later. You know what? Let's. I'd like to start with some simple word associations. Just tell me the first word that pops into your head. For example, I might say \"Day\" and you might say... Wasted. All right. Gun. - Shot. - Agent. Provocateur. Woman. Provocatrix. Heart. Target. Bird. Sky. M. Bitch. Sunlight. Swim. - Moonlight. - Dance. Murder. Employment. - Country. - England. Skyfall. Skyfall. Done. Well, this is going well. Get these analyzed. For her eyes only. She's ready for you. I'm sorry, have we met before? I'm the one who should say \"sorry\". It was only four ribs. Some of the less vital organs. Nothing major. Not enough excitement in Istanbul? I've been reassigned. Temporary suspension from field work. - Really? - Mmm. Something to do with killing 007. Well, you gave it your best shot. That was hardly my best shot. I'm not sure I could survive your best. I doubt you'll get the chance. Well, do me a favor, will you? If they do ever let you back out there, warn me first. I'm assisting Gareth Mallory in the transition, and then I'll be back in the field. That's what you want? Yes, of course. It's not for everyone. Ah, 007. It's this way. In your defense, a moving target is much harder to hit. Then you better keep moving. The whole office goes up in smoke and that bloody thing survives. Your interior decorating tips have always been appreciated, 007."

You have the perfect way out. Go and live quietly somewhere. Not many field agents get to leave this cleanly. Do you get out in the field much? You don't need to be an operative to see the obvious. It's a young man's game. Look, you've been seriously injured. There's no shame in saying you've lost a step. The only shame would be not admitting it until it's too late. Hire me or fire me. It's entirely up to you. If he says he's ready, he's ready. Perhaps you can't see it, or maybe you won't. What exactly are you implying? You're sentimental about him. As long as I'm head of this department, I'll choose my own operatives. Fair enough. Good luck, 007. Don't cock it up. We've analyzed the shrapnel fragments. You're lucky it wasn't a direct hit or it would have cut you in half. It's a depleted uranium shell. Military grade. Hard to get, extremely expensive, and only used by a select few. Recognize anyone? Him. Okay. Name's Patrice. He's a ghost. No known residence or country of origin. So how do we find him? Well, luckily, we still have one or two friends left in the CIA. They're after him for the Yemeni ambassador's murder, and they're getting close. Intel is he's going to be in Shanghai in two days time, probably on a job. You're to go there and await further instructions. If he turns up, he's yours. Find out who he works for and who has the list. Then terminate him, for Ronson. With pleasure. Is there anything else you want to tell me? No. Report to the new Quartermaster for your documentation. He hasn't set up shop yet, but Tanner will put you two together. Good luck. Thank you. 007. You are ready for this? Yes, ma'am. I didn't know Bond passed the tests. He didn't. Always makes me feel a little melancholy. A grand old warship being ignominiously hauled away for scrap.

The controversy surrounding the Ministry of Defence has escalated today as images of the Husein assassination continue to circulate. We should warn you, some viewers might find these images disturbing.

The Prime Minister continues to express public support for MI6 while the opposition has taken the position... Has taken the position we're a bunch of antiquated bloody idiots fighting a war we don't understand and can't possibly win. Look, three of my agents are dead already. Don't embroil me in politics now. The Prime Minister's ordered an inquiry. You'll have to appear. Oh, standing in the stocks at midday? Who's antiquated now? For Christ's sake, listen to yourself. We're a democracy, accountable to the people we're trying to defend. We can't keep working in the shadows. There are no more shadows. You don't get this, do you? Whoever's behind this, whoever's doing it, he knows us. He's one of us. He comes from the same place as Bond. The place you say doesn't exist. The shadows. It's not too late. We could turn back now. I wouldn't be so sure. They abandoned it almost overnight. He made them think there was a leak at the chemical plant. It's amazing the panic you can cause with a single computer. He wanted the island, so he took it. Does he always get what he wants? More than you know. I'm sorry. Hello, James. Welcome.",

My real name. I know you remember it. Your name is on the memorial wall of the very building you attacked. I will have it struck off. Soon your past will be as nonexistent as your future. I'll never see you again. Do you know what it does to you? Hydrogen cyanide? Look upon your work. Mother. Let me know what you recover from his computer. Has he transmitted the lists? If so, to whom? I want this resolved. Yes, ma'am. His name is Tiago Rodriguez. He was a brilliant agent. But he started operating beyond his brief, hacking the Chinese.

        "\"Regret is unprofessional.\" They kept me for five months in a room with no air. They tortured me. And I protected your secrets. I protected you. But they made me suffer. And suffer. And suffer. Until I realized... it was you who betrayed me. You betrayed me. So, I had only one thing left. My cyanide capsule in my back left molar. You remember, right? So I broke the tooth and... bit into the capsule. And it... it burned all my insides. But I didn't die. Life clung to me like a disease. And then... I understood why I had survived. I needed to look in your eyes one last time. Well, I hope it was worth it. Mr. Silva, you're going to be transferred to Belmarsh Prison where you'll be remanded in custody until the Crown Prosecution Service deem you fit to stand trial for... Say my name. Say it. My real name. I know you remember it. Your name is on the memorial wall of the very building you attacked. I will have it struck off. Soon your past will be as nonexistent as your future. I'll never see you again. Do you know what it does to you? Hydrogen cyanide? Look upon your work. Mother. Let me know what you recover from his computer. Has he transmitted the lists? If so, to whom? I want this resolved. Yes, ma'am. His name is Tiago Rodriguez. He was a brilliant agent. But he started operating beyond his brief, hacking the Chinese. The handover was coming up and they were onto him, so I gave him up. I got six agents in return and a peaceful transition. We should go, ma'am. Board of Inquiry begins in 30 minutes.

We couldn't let that go. And this is what we've got. There might be a couple of sticks of dynamite from the quarry. But if all else fails, sometimes the old ways are the best. So who is it we're supposed to be fighting? No \"we\" in it, Kincade. This is not your fight. Try and stop me, you jumped-up little shit. Now, remember what I taught you. Don't let it pull to the left. I'll do my best. What did you say you did for a living? Emma! I brought you some things. The nights get cold here. Thank you, Mr. Kincade. It's a beautiful old house. She is. And like all great ladies, she still has her secret ways. Let me show you this. Priest's hole? Yeah, from Reformation times. The tunnel leads under the moor. If you get in danger, this is the place to come. The night I told him his parents had died, he hid in here for two days. When he did come out... he wasn't a boy anymore. Eh. Must get on. I fucked this up, didn't I? No. You did your job. I read your obituary of me. And? Appalling. Yeah, I knew you'd hate it. I did call you \"an exemplar of British fortitude\". That bit was all right. You ready? I was ready before you were born, son. Welcome to Scotland. You dropped something. You hurt? Only my pride. I never was a good shot. He's not here. Always got to make an entrance. You two, go to the kitchen. Now. Get behind the arch! Go to the chapel. Use the tunnel. Everyone, listen to me! Don't you dare touch her. She's mine. Can your friend come out and say hello? Come on. This way. I always hated this place. Are you getting warm? Just make sure Bond's dead! Now it's me and her. You see what comes of all this running around, Mr. Bond? All this jumping and fighting. It's exhausting! Relax. You need to relax. Ah, well... mother's calling. I'll give her a goodbye kiss for you. Oh, my God. Of course. It had to be here. It had to be this way. Thank you. - I can't find it no... - Don't. Please. Don't. You're hurt. You're hurt. What have they done to you? Free both of us. Free both of us... with the same bullet. Do it. Only you can do it. Do it. Ah! Last rat standing. 007. What took you so long? Well, I got into some deep water.",
