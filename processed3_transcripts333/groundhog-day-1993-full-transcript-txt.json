Out in California, they'll have warm weather tomorrow... ...gang wars and some very overpriced real estate. In the Pacific Northwest, they'll have some... ...very, very tall trees. Clear across the Rockies and Great Plains. But look out, here comes trouble. Oh, boy! Front coming our way! Look out! What will that mean to us? One of these big, blue things! This cold, frigid arctic air, this big mass out of the north. It'll meet up with all this moisture coming up out of the Gulf. They'll mix at high altitudes and cause snow. Going out on a limb: Not gonna hit us here in Pittsburgh. Gonna push off and hit Altoona. Close call! Let's look at the five-day. As you can see, nothing to be too scared about. Bundle up warm, but you can leave your galoshes at home. I won't be here for the 10:00. Tomorrow's Groundhog Day. I'll be in Punxsutawney... ...for our country's oldest groundhog festival. According to the legend, tomorrow, February 2nd... ...if the groundhog wakes and sees his shadow... ...we've got six more weeks of winter. So cross your fingers. Sounds like fun. You must really enjoy it. This is your third year in a row. Four, Nan. - Four. - Thanks, Phil. Next, our entertainment editor looks at sex and violence in movies. Stay with us. - And we're clear. - Have fun in Punxsutawney, Phil. For your information, Hairdo, a major network is interested in me. Yeah. That would be the Home Shopping Network. Thanks, Larry. Go wait in the van, will you? That was nice, Phil. \"Big trees\"! Stop, Kenny. Look, can you handle the 10 or not? Yeah, yeah. If you don't want to rush back, I can do the 5 tomorrow. Come on, I wanna stay an extra second in Punxsutawney? Please! Look, Rita thinks it'd be a great idea... ...to stay for some of the other events. Get some incredible footage. The people and the fun. The excitement. You haven't worked with her yet, have you? She's really nice. I think she'll be a really good producer. You guys are gonna have fun. She's fun. But not my kind of fun. I will be here for the 5. Rita! Can you keep a secret, Larry? I'm probably leaving PBH. So this will be the last time we do the Groundhog together.",

No, thank you. I've seen Larry eat. You get your sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Don't be late. Did he actually call himself \"the talent\"? Okay, campers, rise and shine!

Here's the report. The National Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing. There's another reason today's especially exciting... Especially cold.

Come here, groundhog! - Morning! - Morning. - Off to see the groundhog? - Yes, I am. Think it'll be an early spring? I'm predicting March 21 st. Good guess!

You tossed and turned, didn't you? You're incredible. Who told you? Okay. It's groundhog time. Okay. On me in three... ...two, one. Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn to this tiny hamlet... ...to watch a master at work. The master? Punxsutawney Phil... ...the world's most famous weatherman. The groundhog. Who, as legend has it, can predict the coming of an early spring. So the question we have to ask ourselves today is: \"Does Phil feel lucky?\" Every year, the guy comes out with a big stick and raps on the door. They pull the little rat out, they talk to him. The rat talks back. Then they tell us what's gonna happen. Isn't he cute? Hey. Do you like your guys with prominent upper teeth? No. This February 2nd, at 7:20 and 30 seconds... ...Punxsutawney Phil... ...the seer of seers... ...prognosticator of prognosticators... ...emerged reluctantly but alertly... ...in Punxsutawney, PA... ...and stated in groundhog-ese: \"I definitely see a shadow.\" Sorry, folks. Six more weeks of winter. On me in three, two, one. This is one time where television really fails... ...to capture the true excitement of a large squirrel... ...predicting the weather. I for one am grateful to have been here. From Punxsutawney... ...this is Phil Connors. So long. Okay. Want to try it again without the sarcasm? We got it. I'm out of here. Prima donnas. Oh, boy. Take a look at this. What is going on? I don't know, Phil. Perhaps it's that blizzard we're not supposed to get. This is impossible. Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Nobody honks this horn but me, okay, pal? No, no! Take this rig out of here. Hey, commander, what's going on? Nothing. We're closing the road. - Big blizzard moving in. - It's a couple of flakes. Don't you listen to the weather? We got a major storm. I make the weather. All this moisture from the Gulf will push off to the east in Altoona. Pal, you got that moisture on your head. You can go back to Punxsutawney... ...or you can freeze to death. It's your choice. So, what's it gonna be? I'm thinking. Come on, all the long-distance lines are down? What about the satellite? Is it snowing in space? Don't you keep a line open for emergencies or for celebrities?",

        "Then they go sit by the fire and get warm. And then they come back and they sing some more! Yeah. They're hicks, Rita. So did you sleep okay without me? You tossed and turned, didn't you? You're incredible. Who told you? Okay. It's groundhog time. Okay. On me in three... ...two, one. Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn to this tiny hamlet... ...to watch a master at work. The master? Punxsutawney Phil... ...the world's most famous weatherman. The groundhog. Who, as legend has it, can predict the coming of an early spring. So the question we have to ask ourselves today is: \"Does Phil feel lucky?\" Every year, the guy comes out with a big stick and raps on the door. They pull the little rat out, they talk to him. The rat talks back. Then they tell us what's gonna happen. Isn't he cute? Hey. Do you like your guys with prominent upper teeth? No. This February 2nd, at 7:20 and 30 seconds... ...Punxsutawney Phil... ...the seer of seers... ...prognosticator of prognosticators... ...emerged reluctantly but alertly... ...in Punxsutawney, PA... ...and stated in groundhog-ese: \"I definitely see a shadow.\" Sorry, folks. Six more weeks of winter. On me in three, two, one. This is one time where television really fails... ...to capture the true excitement of a large squirrel... ...predicting the weather. I for one am grateful to have been here. From Punxsutawney... ...this is Phil Connors. So long. Okay. Want to try it again without the sarcasm? We got it. I'm out of here. Prima donnas. Oh, boy. Take a look at this. What is going on? I don't know, Phil. Perhaps it's that blizzard we're not supposed to get. This is impossible. Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Nobody honks this horn but me, okay, pal? No, no! Take this rig out of here. Hey, commander, what's going on? Nothing. We're closing the road. - Big blizzard moving in. - It's a couple of flakes. Don't you listen to the weather? We got a major storm. I make the weather. All this moisture from the Gulf will push off to the east in Altoona. Pal, you got that moisture on your head. You can go back to Punxsutawney... ...or you can freeze to death. It's your choice. So, what's it gonna be? I'm thinking. Come on, all the long-distance lines are down? What about the satellite? Is it snowing in space? Don't you keep a line open for emergencies or for celebrities?"

Let me give you a hand. No, no. You got your coffee. I'll get it. Thanks. We never talk, Larry. Do you have kids? - Yes? - Yes, I'd like a piano lesson, please. I'm with a student. But if you want to come back tomorrow... I kind of wanna get started. I could give you $1000. Come on in. Morning! Off to see the groundhog? You think it's gonna be an early spring? Winter, slumbering in the open air Wears on his smiling face A dream of spring Ciao! Ciao! Phil! Rita, hi. Hey, Lar. Hi. How's she look? - Great! - Thank you. - Did you know he could ice-sculpt? - No. Not bad, Mr. Connors. You say this is your first lesson? Yes, but my father was a piano mover, so... Phil? - Phil Connors, I thought it was you. - Ned Ryerson. I have missed you so much. I don't know where you're headed, but can you call in sick? I gotta get going. It's good to see you, Phil. Hello, Father. Let's get you someplace warm, all right? Yeah. Yeah. Remember me? Excuse me, sir? You brought the old man in? How is he? Well, he just passed away. - What did he die of? - He was just old. It was just his time. - I wanna see his chart. Excuse me. - Sir! Sir, you can't come in here. Sir, this is a restricted area. Where's the chart? Sometimes people just die. Not today. Gets hard down there at the bottom. Here you go. Thank you. Come on, Dad. Come on, Pop. Come on, Pop. Come on. Come on. Come on, breathe. Breathe, Pop! Breathe, Pop! When Chekhov saw the long winter... ...he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope."
