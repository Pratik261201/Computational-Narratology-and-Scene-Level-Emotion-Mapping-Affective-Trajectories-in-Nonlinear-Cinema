Tell me what you think it is. Is it a star? It is a star. Very good. That's great. Okay. All right. Think hard. What is it? Circle. Close. But definitely wrong. Okay. - All right. Ready? - Yeah. All right. What is it? Come on. Figure eight. Incredible. That's 5 for 5. You can't see these, can you? - You're not cheating me, are you? - No, I swear they're just coming to me. Okay. - Nervous? - Yes. I don't like this. You only have 75 more to go, okay? What's this one? It's a couple of wavy lines. - Sorry. This isn't your lucky day. - I know. Wait... I'm getting a little tired of this! You volunteered, didn't you? We're paying, aren't we? Yeah, but I didn't know you were gonna give me electric shocks! What are you trying to prove here, anyway? I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability. The effect? I'll tell you what the effect is. It's pissing me off! Well, then maybe my theory is correct! - You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it. - I will, mister! You may as well get used to that. It's the kind of resentment that your ability will provoke in some people. Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman? You're no fluke, Jennifer. This is it. This is definitely it! Did those UV lenses come in for the video camera? And that blank tape, I need it, the one you erased yesterday. - Will you excuse me for a second? - Sure. I'm right in the middle of something, Ray. I need more time with this subject. Could you come back in an hour, hour and a half? Peter, at 1:40 p. M... ...at the main branch of The New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue... ...10 people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso, vaporous apparition. It blew books off shelves from 20 feet away... ...and scared the socks off some poor librarian. I'm very excited. I'm very pleased. I want you to get right down there, check it out, and get back to me. You're coming with us on this one. Spengler went down there. He took PKE valences, went right off the top of the scale. Buried the needle. We're close on this one. I can feel it. I can feel it. We're very, very close. I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd like to work with you some more.",

I'd call that a big yes. Are you habitually using drugs, stimulants, alcohol? - No. - No, no. Just asking. Are you, Alice, menstruating right now? - What has that got to do with it? - Back off, man. I'm a scientist. Ray, it's moving. Come on. Look! - This is hot, Ray. - Symmetrical book-stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947. You're right. No human being would stack books like this. Listen! Do you smell something? Talk about telekinetic activity. Look at this mess. Raymond, look at this. Ectoplasmic residue. - Venkman, get a sample of this. - It's the real thing. Somebody blows their nose, and you wanna keep it? I'd like to analyze it. - There's more over here. - I'm getting stronger readings here. This way. Come on. Egon, your mucus. This happen to you before? First time? It's here. A full torso apparition. And it's real. So, what do we do? Could you come over here and talk to me for a second, please? Could you just come here for a second, please? Right over here. Come here, Francine.",

There's metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members. The wiring is substandard. It's inadequate for our power needs. And the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone.

Just ordered some more vitamins and stuff. I was just exercising. I taped 20-Minute Workout and played it at high speed... ...so it took 10 minutes. Got a great workout. Want to come in for a mineral water? I'd really like to, Louis, but I have a rehearsal. Excuse me. No sweat. I'll take a rain check on that. I have plenty of low-sodium mineral water and other nutritious foods. - But you already know that. - I know that. That reminds me, I'm having a big party for all my clients.",

I believe that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump. - For what purpose? - To go into business for ourselves. This ecto-containment system Spengler and I have in mind... ...will require a load of capital. Where will we get the money? I don't know. I don't know. You're never gonna regret this, Ray. My parents left me that house. I was born there. You won't lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages nowadays. But at 19 percent? You didn't even bargain with the guy. Ray, for your information, the interest rate alone... ...for the first five years comes to 95,000 dollars. Will you guys relax? We are on the threshold of establishing... ...the indispensable defense science of the next decade: Professional paranormal investigations and eliminations. The franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams. There's office space, sleeping quarters and showers... ...and there's a full kitchen. It just seems a little pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity, that's all. What do you think, Egon? I think this building should be condemned. There's metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members. The wiring is substandard. It's inadequate for our power needs. And the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone. Hey, does this pole still work? Wow, this place is great. When can we move in? You gotta try this pole. I'm gonna get my stuff. Hey, we should stay here tonight, sleep here. You know, to try it out. - I think we'll take it. - Good. Hi. - Dana, it's you. - Hi. Yes, Louis, it's me. - I thought it was the drugstore. - Are you sick? No, I'm fine. I feel great. Just ordered some more vitamins and stuff. I was just exercising. I taped 20-Minute Workout and played it at high speed... ...so it took 10 minutes. Got a great workout. Want to come in for a mineral water? I'd really like to, Louis, but I have a rehearsal. Excuse me. No sweat. I'll take a rain check on that. I have plenty of low-sodium mineral water and other nutritious foods. - But you already know that. - I know that. That reminds me, I'm having a big party for all my clients."

        "It's more of a guideline than a rule. You know, I can... I want you inside me. Go ahead. No, I can't. Sounds like you got at least two people in there already. Might be a little crowded. Come on, why don't you just quit trying... ...to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman and just relax. Lie down there. Relax. Put your hands on your chest. What I'd really like to do is talk to Dana. I want to talk to Dana. Dana, it's Peter. There is no Dana. There is only Zuul. Oh, Zuulie, you nut. Come on. Come on, I want to talk to Dana. Dana. Just relax. Come on. Dana. Dana. Can I talk to Dana? There is no Dana, only Zuul. What a lovely singing voice you must have. Now, I'm gonna count to three, Zuulie. And if I don't talk to Dana... ...there's gonna be some real trouble in this apartment, I think. One. Two. Two and a half. Please come down. I am the Keymaster. The Destructor is coming. The Traveler. The Destroyer. Gatekeeper. I am Vinz. Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer. Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper? He pulls the wagon, I make the deals. You want a ride? Wait for the sign. Then all prisoners will be released. You will perish in flame, you and all your kind! Gatekeeper! What an asshole. - Dropping off or picking up? - Dropping off. Just a moment. - You a Ghostbuster? - Yes. We picked up this guy. We don't know what to do. Bellevue doesn't want him. I'm afraid to lock him up. I know you guys are into this stuff, so I figured we'd check. All right. Are you the Gatekeeper? You better bring him inside. You are so kind to take care of that man. You know, you are a real humanitarian. I don't think he's human. What did you say your name was? Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer. According to this, his name's Louis Tully. Lives on Central Park West. Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully? - Do I? - Yes, have some. Yes, have some. Vinz, you said before you were waiting for a sign. - What sign are you waiting for? - Gozer the Traveler. He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During rectification of the Vuldronaii, the Traveler came as a large Torb. Then, during the third reconciliation of the Meketrex supplicants... ...they chose a new form for him, that of a giant Sloar! Many Shubs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted... ...in the depths of the Sloar that day, I can tell you."
