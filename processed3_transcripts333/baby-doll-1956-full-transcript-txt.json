Baby Doll. Archie Lee, you're a mess. Do you know what they call such people? Peeping Toms! Hey, there's no need for a woman that sleeps in a baby's crib... ...to stay away from her husband. I'm gonna plug up the hole in that wall with chewing gum. If I ever catch you poking a knife through it again to peek at me in my sleep... ...I'm moving in to the Kotton King Hotel. And would you please keep your filthy old dogs off my furniture. Let me talk to you. -I wanna talk with you. -Spare your breath. Save it to drum up some business for your broken-down cotton gin. -Never mind-- -Close the door so I can get into my clothes. Get in your clothes. Not till you get on the other side of that door and close it between us. Today is the fifth day of November, tomorrow is the sixth day... ...and the day after that is November seventh. And you know what day that is, don't you? November seventh is your 20th birthday. Ain't that sweet of you to remember. Where's my birthday present? Oh, you'll get your birthday present. Providing you haven't forgotten the agreement between us... ...which comes due on that day. -Oh, the agreement? -Yeah, the agreement. -Which you swore on a Bible to keep. -Providing you kept yours. -Have I touched you since we were married? -Yeah, often. And got slapped. Have I? Have I ever--? Ever once forced myself on you... ...as your husband by law? But don't the law mean nothing to you. How about your side of the agreement? You talked big, mighty big when you was courting me, big shot. You told my daddy you was gonna put me in the grandest house in the county. I put you in Tiger Tail. I bought it and I put you in it. And Tiger Tail is the grandest house in the county. Yeah, you put me in Tiger Tail, the biggest old wreck of a place in the whole delta. You told my daddy you was gonna restore this place. Exactly like it was when the Dobines owned it, only better. \"Make a show place,\" you said. Yeah, a freak show. I've got a boy on the roof right now. I got my man on the roof right now.",

What do you do? Can you type? No. No, I don't do no typing. But... ...well, I print a real good hand. I don't know whether we can use that, though. You're awful young to be a dentist. Yeah, I'm just getting started. Well, what's the matter with you? -I haven't been myself, John. -In what way? Well, you know, Archie Lee, you're not an old man... ...but you're not a young man neither no more. That's the truth, John. That's no lie. -How long you been married now? -Just about a year now. Well.... -She's pretty, though. -Yeah, I guess so. Youth, huh? You've been under some strain, ain't you? No. No strain at all. -You look mighty nervous to me. -I'm not nervous-- Well, you'd have to know typing. It's typing. -Awfully nice talking to you. -Yes, ma'am. Mr. Meighan, come back in here. The doctor's gonna give you a prescription. Archie Lee, all I think you need is some kind of a little harmless sedative. You take this down to old man Hogan, tell him to fill it. -Take it according to directions. -Here you are. Don't forget your sweater.",

You don't think that I am gonna cook for a big, fat, old thing like you. -Quit saying \"fat, old thing\". -Get young and thin and I'll quit. All right, but I am serving you notice. If that old woman dies on my place, I ain't gonna get stuck with the funeral expenses. I'll have her burned up. \"Cremated\" is what they call it. I'll pack her ashes in an old Coca-Cola bottle... ...and I'll pitch that bottle into Tiger Tail Bayou. Mr. Meighan, you are late for your appointment. The doctor's gonna see you anyway, I don't know why. Oh, hey. Well, hi. -Are you the dentist? -Yes, ma'am. I'm the dentist. Well, I was scouting around for a job and I noticed your sign. And I thought I might help you out. What are you doing, John? There was a fellow in here just a little while ago beat me at playing checkers. And I still can't figure out why. Well.... What do you do? Can you type? No. No, I don't do no typing. But... ...well, I print a real good hand. I don't know whether we can use that, though. You're awful young to be a dentist. Yeah, I'm just getting started. Well, what's the matter with you? -I haven't been myself, John. -In what way? Well, you know, Archie Lee, you're not an old man... ...but you're not a young man neither no more. That's the truth, John. That's no lie. -How long you been married now? -Just about a year now. Well.... -She's pretty, though. -Yeah, I guess so. Youth, huh? You've been under some strain, ain't you? No. No strain at all. -You look mighty nervous to me. -I'm not nervous-- Well, you'd have to know typing. It's typing. -Awfully nice talking to you. -Yes, ma'am. Mr. Meighan, come back in here. The doctor's gonna give you a prescription. Archie Lee, all I think you need is some kind of a little harmless sedative. You take this down to old man Hogan, tell him to fill it. -Take it according to directions. -Here you are. Don't forget your sweater."

Don't be so skittish. All right, I'll get up, then. Go on. I feel so weak. My head is buzzy. Buzzy? Fuzzy and buzzy. My head is swinging round. Must have been that swinging that done it. -Is there something on my arm? -No. Well, then cut it out, it feels funny. -How does it feel? -Oh, it feels funny all up and down. -Quit switching me, will you? -I'm just shooing the flies off. They don't hurt nothing. -Now, cut it out or I'm gonna call. -You're gonna call who? -Boy on the road. -Well, go on, call then. Boy! Can't you call any louder? -Oh, I feel so-- -Can't you call any louder? I feel so funny. What's--? -What's the matter with me? -You're just relaxing. -Give in, now. Stop fighting it. -Oh, I'm not.... -I'm not fighting it, but it's you... -I? ...and your suspicions... -...about my husband. Suspicions-- -Suspicions? Suspicions such as? That he burnt down your gin. -Well? -Well, he didn't. -Didn't he? -No, he didn't. He-- He didn't. I'm going in the house now. You believe in ghosts, Mrs. Meighan? I do. I believe in the presence of evil spirits. What evil spirits you talking about? Spirits of violence and cunning... ...malevolence, cruelty, treachery, destruction. Them's just human characteristics. The evil spirits that haunt the human heart and take possession of it... ...and spread from one human heart to another human heart... ...the way a fire goes springing from leaf to leaf... ...and branch to branch in a tree till a forest is all aflame with it. You just got fire on the brain. I see it as more than it seems to be on the surface. I saw it last night as an explosion of those evil spirits. I fought it. I ran into it, beating it, stamping it, shouting the curse of God at it. They dragged me out suffocating. I was defeated. When I came to, lying on the ground... ...the fire had won the battle. And all around was a ring of human figures. I looked up. They were illuminated. Their eyes, their teeth were shining like this."

Now, as to the other side of the situation, which I won't mention... ...well, all I can say is a certain attraction exists. Mutually, I believe. I needed a little shuteye after last night's excitement. And I have a faint recollection of being sung to by someone. A lullaby song that was sweet... ...and a touch of cool fingers. -You think I'm gonna put up with this? -But that's all, absolutely. -You think I'm gonna put up--? -With this situation? You went to whole lot of risk and trouble to get my business back. -Cool. -Don't you want it? -Yeah, cool. -It's up to you, Archie. -Very cool. -It's up to you. -You just fixed your wagon. -Yeah. With this smart talk, oh, you just fixed your wagon. I'm gonna wipe that grin off your greasy wop face for good. Oh, you just-- You watch. Is my wop face greasy, Mrs. Meighan? That's the last time you're ever gonna lay your hands on me again, you stinker! You stinking stinker! Stinker! Look out, Silva! Rock? Rock, where are you? Where are you, Vacarro? Where are you? Where you hiding, wop? Oh, if you're under there, you ain't getting out. Look, my husband's got a gun, and I just don't know-- Hey, wop! Oh, you yellow-bellied wop. Get that gun! Get that gun away from him! Help! Help! Where's that wop? You can't get away! Go away from me! Get away! Where are you, Vacarro? Right here, neighbor. There you are. Oh, it's you. Excuse me. Silva? Here. Here. Where are you, Vacarro? Come on. You yellow-bellied wop! Baby Doll! Where are you, Vacarro? Where are you, Vacarro? Vacarro! Come on out, Vacarro! Now, you put that gun of yours away!"
