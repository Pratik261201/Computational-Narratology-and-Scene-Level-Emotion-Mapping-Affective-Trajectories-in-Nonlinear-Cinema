The cow goes, moo, the horse goes, neigh. It's all people talked about back then. Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's true. What are you doing out here? Well, there's not much call for imaginary friends, lately. So, I, you know... Hey, hey, don't be sad. Tell you what, when I get back up to Headquarters, I'll make sure Riley remembers you. - You will? - Of course! She'd love that. Ha-haa! This is the greatest day of my life! Hot-cha-cha... Ow ow ow... - Are you OK? - Hey, what's going on? I cry candy. - Try the caramel, it's delicious. - Oo! Woah! - Oo! Here use this. - Thanks. Oh, hold on. Wait a second. It always get stuck at the bottom. Here. Wha...? It's imaginary! Thanks! This will make it a lot easier to walk back to Headquarters. Walk?! We're not walking. We're taking the Train of Thought. The Train, of course! That is so much faster. But how do we catch it? Well, it kinda goes all over the place but there is a station in Imagination Land. I know a shortcut. Come on, this way. Oh, I'm so glad we ran into you. The station is right in here. After you. - Joy. - What? I read about this place in the manual We shouldn't go in there. Bing Bong says it's the quickest way to Headquarters. No, but Joy, this is abstract thought. What are you talking about? I go in here all the time. It's a shortcut, you see? D-A-N-G-E-R: Shortcut! I'll prove it to you. Look at me. I'm closer to the station. 'Cause I'm taking the shortcut. Let's go around. This way. Almost there, now! If you wanna walk the long way, go for it. But Riley needs to be happy. I'm not missing that Train. Bing Bong knows what he is doing. He's part dolphin, they're very smart. Well, I guess. OK, what abstract concept are we trying to comprehend today? Ahm, loneliness. Hm, looks like there's something in there. I'm gonna turn it on for a minute and burn out the gunk. What did I tell ya? You'll be in Headquarters in no time! Hey, will you look at that? - Woah! What's happening? - Oh no, they turned it on! Huh? Never seen this before. Whaaat?! Aahh! My face! My beautiful face! No! - What is going on? - We're abstracting. There are 4 stages. This is the first. Non-objective fragmentation. Alright, do not panic! What is important is that we all stay together. - Oh! - Ah! We're in the second stage, we’re deconstructing! Run! Ah, I can't feel my legs! Oh, there they are. Come here, me! We gotta get outta here, before we're not even shape and color! We'll get stuck here forever! Bong, why did we come in here? I told you, it's a shortcut. The Train! Oh no, we're 2 dimensional! That's stage 3. We're getting nowhere. - Depth! I'm lacking depth. - Come on! We can't fit. Oh no, we're not figurative! This is the last stage. We're not gonna make it. Ohh! Wait, we're 2 dimensional. Fall on your face. Stop. Stop! Oh, no! You said that was a shortcut. I did. But wow, we should not have gone in there! That was dangerous. They, really, should put up a sign. - How long till the next Train? - Who knows? But don’t worry. There's another station. That way. The Train always stops there, right before it goes to Headquarters. If we hurry, we can catch it. This isn't another one of your shortcuts, is it? Ha-ha-ha! Yeah! Is there really another station? Uh-huh. Through there. Welcome to Imagination Land! Imagination Land? Sure, I come here all the time. I'm practically the mayor. Hey, you guys hungry? There's French Fry Forest. No way?! Ha-ha-ha! Check it out. Trophy Town. Medals, ribbons... everyone's a winner. I won first place! Me too! Oh, participation award! Wait, is that?... Is that a?... Look. It's Cloud Town. That's my favorite, hoo-hoo-hoo! - Oh, it's so soft. - O-ho, let me try. Hey, what's the big idea? You'd better fix that wall or else you're in big trouble. - Oh no, lava! - Woo. Woah! Imagination Land is the best. Oh, is it all gonna be so interactive? Hey look, the House of Cards! Oh, wait! Hang on just a minute. Ah, your rocket! Yeah, I stashed it in there for safekeeping. And now I'm all set to take Riley to the moon! - Oh, I'm sorry. - Great! -Oh, I love Imagination Land! - Isn't it great? And there's always something new like... - Who the heck is that? - Imaginary boyfriend. - I would die for Riley. - Oh, blekh! - I've never seen him before. - I live in Canada. Anyway. This way, through Preschool World. We're nearly to the train. Riley, here we come. Woo-hoo! Ha-ha-ha! This should be fun. New team, new friends... There kids look pretty good. Considering they're from San Francisco. Heheh! - Gotta go. - OK. Good luck, sweetie! Luck isn't going to help us now. If she tries to use Hockey Island, it's going down. Which is why, I've recalled every hockey memory I can think of. One of these has gotta work in place of the core memory. - She's about to play. - Hurry. Ha ha! We did it gang. It's working! Oh! Line change! Change it up! Haha! No-no. Aahh! It's like we don't learn anything. - That's it! - No no, breathe... find your happy place. Aaarggh! - Riley, what's wrong? - Let's go. - You're not going to finish tryouts? - What's the point? Hey, it'll be alright. Let's just... Stop saying everything will be alright! Nice hustling, ladies! Hockey?! Oh no no, she loves hockey, she can't give up hockey! Bing Bong, we have to get to that station. Sure thing. This way, just past Graham Cracker Castle. Hey, that's weird! Graham Cracker Castle used to be right here, I wonder why they moved it. I would've sworn, Sparkle Pony Mountain was right here. - Hey, what's going on? - Y-yeah, I dunno, - we'll have to come back. - Princess Dreamworld! Oh, the Stuffed Animal Hall of Fame! My rocket? Wait, Riley and I we're still using that rocket. It still has some song power left. ♪ Who's your friend who likes to play? - ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ No! No no. You can't take my rocket to the Dump. Riley and I are going to the moon! Riley can't be done with me? Hey, it's gonna be OK! We can fix this! We just need to get back to Headquarters. Which way to the Train station? I had a whole trip planned for us. Hey, who's ticklish? Here comes the tickle monster! Hey, Bing Bong, look at this. Blgoyoyngg! Oh, here's a fun game. You point to the Train station and we all go there. Won't that be fun? Come on, let's go to the Train station! I'm sorry they took your rocket. They took something that you loved. It's gone, forever. - Sadness, don't make him feel worse. - Sorry. It's all I had left of Riley. I bet you and Riley had great adventures. Oh, they were wonderful. Once, we flew back in time. We had breakfast twice that day. Sadness. It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it. Oh, she did. We were best friends. Yeah. It's sad. Wha...? I'm OK now. Come on. The Train station is this way. - How did you do that? - Oh, I don't know. I feel he's sad, so, I listen to what... Hey! ... There's the Train. Oh, we made it, we're finally gonna get home! Oh no, these facts and opinions look so similar. Ah, don't worry about it. Happens all the time. On a scale of 1 to 10. I give this day an 'F'. Well, why don't we quit standing around and do something. Like what, genius? Like quitting. That's what I'm doing. Sure, it's the coward's way out. But this coward's gonna survive! Emotions can't quit, genius. Ugh! I thought we're supposed to be keeping Riley happy. Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Aha! Ho ho ho... - What is it? - Oh nothing. - Just the best idea ever. - What? All the good core memories were made in Minnesota. Ergo, we go back to Minnesota and make more. Ta-dah! Wait wait wait. You're saying, we run away? Well, I wouldn't call it that. I'd call it the Happy Core Memory Development Program. - You can't be serious. - Hey, our life was perfect. Until Mon and Dad decided to move to San Fran-stinko. But, I mean, it's just so drastic. Need I remind you of how great things were there? Our room. Our backyard. Our friends. ♪ Tripledent gum will make you smile Did I ask for the gum commercial? Anyway, it was better. That's my point. - Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota. - Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we just sleep on this or something? Fine, let's sleep on it. Because, hey, I'm sure jolly fun-filled times are just around the corner. Huh? Hey hey, why aren't we moving? Riley's gone to sleep. We're all on break. You mean we're stuck here until morning? Yeah, the Train of Thought doesn't run while she's asleep. - Oh, we can't wait that long. - How about we wake her up. Sadness, that's ridiculous. How can we possibly... - How about we wake her up. - Great idea Joy. Thanks, come on! Woh, this place is huge! It looks so much smaller than I expected. Wow, 'I Can Fly'! I love that one! Rainbow Unicorn. She's right there. My friend says you're famous. - She wants your autograph. - No no, Sadness. Don't bother Miss Unicorn, OK? Sorry she's from out of town. It's so embarrassing, right? I loved you in Fairy Dream Adventure part 7. OK bye. I love you. Hah! Wonder what that means? Oh well, let's go in. Set up the classroom set. Today's memories are in. We've got a lot to work with here. Riley dumped her best friend, had a miserable day at school and quit hockey. The writers have put together a killer script. Just because Joy and Sadness are gone, I have to do stupid dream duty. OK, how are we gonna wake her up? Well, she wakes up sometimes when she has a scary dream. - We could scare her. - Scare her? - No no. She's been through enough already. - But, Joy. Sadness, you may know your way around down here. But I know Riley. We're gonna make her so happy, she'll wake up with exhilaration We'll excite her awake. That's never happen before. Oo, Riley loves dogs. Put this on. I don't think that'll work. - Bing Bong. - Yeah. Don't let anything happen to these. Got it. M-hm! Add the reality distortion filter. Love it. Remember, play to the camera everyone. Riley is the camera. Make-up get outta there. We are on in 5 4 3... Hello class! Before we begin today’s pop quiz... Man, she is one bad actress! ...final grade, I want to introduce our new student. Riley, would you like to stand up and introduce yourself? Camera. And, cue Riley. My name is Riley Anderson. I'm from Minnesota and now I live here. Ew! Look, her teeth are falling out. That's gross! Teeth falling out. Pfft! Yeah, I'm used to that one. Lemme guess, we have no pants on. Hey, look, she came to school with no pants on! Called it! - Ready? - I don't think this happy thing is going to work. - But if we scare her. - Just follow my lead. Here we go. - Aahh, oo! - Bark-bark-bark! - Who is that? - Uhm.. what's going on? Psst, you're on, go! Wooh, let's party! Let's dance. Wooh! Hey, a party! Bark-bark-bark! Joy, this isn't working. No. Huh? ... Sadness, what are you doing? Come back here. It's just a dream. It's just a dream. It's just a dream. They're trying to wake her up! Call security! - Hi Riley, it's me! - Bing Bong?! ♪ ...friend who likes to play? Bing Bong, Bing Bong Sadness, you are ruining this dream. - You're scaring her. - But look, it's working. Woh! They're not part of this dream. Get them. Stop right there! Pan away. Pan away! Boo! Pick a plot line! Ow, careful! You can't do this! I know people in Headquarters. No-no-no... There go the core memories! Come on. - What is this place? - The subconscious. It's where they take all the troublemakers. My hat feels loose. How do we get in? Have you got my hat, or is that your hat? Yeah, it's my hat. You sure? I dunno, look on the label. Yeah, it says my hat. - Wait, it says \"my hat\"? - \"My hat\", it says. - That's what I wrote in my hat. - What are you talking about? - Ah, you got my hat on. - OK, it's my hat. - Hey you! - Oh, you caught us. Get back in there! No escaping. Oh! I don't like it here. It's where they keep Riley's darkest fears. It's broccoli. The stairs to the basement. Grandma's vacuum cleaner, aah! OK, come on. - Would you walk quieter. - I'm trying. What is going... Candy wrappers? - Bing Bong! - Joy? - There you are! - Shh! Uhh! It's Jangles! Who's the birthday girl? Birthday girl? - Do you have the core memories? - Yeah. All he cared about was the candy. Shh! We're outta here. Let's get to that Train. Wait, the Train's not running. We still have to wake up Riley. But how? Oh no! Hey Sadness, did you hear about the p-party they were having? Yeah, yeah Joy. Isn't it a b-b-birthday party? Did you say birthday? - And there's going to be cake and presents. - And games and balloons. A Birthday? OK, follow us. Nothing like a good scare to wake you up, right? OK, but it's my handwriting. No, it isn't. It's my hat, I wrote that. No, but this one's my ha... Who's the birthday girl? Aah! - Woo-hoo! - Come on, let's go! - Ha ha, we made it! - Ha ha! Guess who's on their way to Headquarters? We are! - What is going on? - He did it again. We were at school and we were naked, and there was a dog... The back half was... was chasing it... - It was Bing Bong. - You idiot, it was a dream! This is ridiculous! We can't even get a good night sleep anymore. Time to take action. Stupid Mon and Dad, if they hadn't moved us none of this would have happened. Who's with me? Yeah, let's do it. She took it. There's no turning back. So, how are we going to get to Minnesota from here? Well, why don't we go down to the elephant lot and rent an elephant? Hey, that sounds nice! We're taking the bus, nitwit! There's a bus leaving tomorrow. Perfect! A ticket costs money. How do we get money? - Mom's purse. - Oh, you wouldn't! Oh, but I would. Where was it we saw it last? ♪ Tripledent gum... - NOOO!! - Aah! It's downstairs somewhere. Mom and Dad got us into this mess, they can pay to get us out. How about this, huh? Is this nice? You can see everything from up here. Look, there's Inductive Reasoning. There's Deja Vu. There's Language Processing. There's Deja Vu. There's Critical Thinking. There's Deja Vu. And look at this, guys. Memories! Hey, that was a good idea, about scaring Riley awake. - You're not so bad. - Really? Nice work. Ah, I can't wait to get the old Riley back. As soon as we get there, I'm gonna fix this whole mess. Wow, is this Riley? She's so big now, she won't fit in my rocket. How are we gonna get to the moon? Oh, it's that time in the Twistee Tree, remember? The hockey team showed up and Mon and Dad were there cheering. Look at her, having fun and laughing. - Ah, I love this one. - Hm, I love that one too. - Atta girl! Now you're getting it. - Yeah. It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful, she wanted to quit. Sorry, I went sad again, didn't I? I'll tell you what, we can keep working on that when we get back, OK? OK. I just don't understand. Why did our moving van even go to Texas? Multiple customers? Well, we were promised delivery on the 5th. Uh-huh. Excuse me, isn't there any way that you can rush it? Honesty Island? Look out! Aaahh! Come on! Hold on! - Hurry up. - Jump over here! - Go-go-go. - I got it. - Pull! - Pull! That was our way home. We lost another island. What is happening? Haven't you heard? Riley's running away. What? Wait wait! Hang on, guys. Are we really doing this? This is serious. Look, we have no core memories. You want Riley to be happy? Let's get back to Minnesota and make more. Joy, if we hurry, we can still stop her. Family Island. Let's go! Joy! Joy, it's too dangerous, we won't make it in time. But, that's our only way back. A recall tube. We can get recall. Have a great day, sweetheart. - See you after school, monkey. - We love you. Go, run run! Go! Whoa-whoa, Sadness! Sadness, stop! - You're hurting Riley. - No no no, I did it again! If you get in here, these core memories will get sad. I'm sorry. - Riley needs to be happy. - Joy? Aaah! Joy! Aaah! Joy! Joy? Joy! Joy, Joy, what are you doing? Will you stop it, please. Don't you get it, Joy? We're stuck down here! We're forgotten. (We used to play tag, and stuff.) (But, everything's different now.) (Since we moved.) Do you remember, how she used to stick her tongue out when she was coloring? I could listen to her stories all day. I just wanted Riley to be happy. It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful. She wanted to quit. Sadness. Mom and Dad, the team; they came to help because of sadness. We have to get back up there. Joy, we're stuck down here. We might as well be on another planet.

Why isn't it working? - Lemme try! - Wait. You broke it. - No. - Move. Move. - Let me do it. Get outta here! No. Guys, we can't make Riley feel anything. What have we done? Hey! Hey, look at me. Did you mean what you said before? I would die for Riley. I would die for Riley. Yeah, OK, haircut. Time to prove it! I would die for Riley. I would die for Riley. I would die for Riley. I would die for Riley. Ah, hoo-hoo! Boo hoo-hoo! That's it, I fold! Whoaaaa! - Whoa. - Whoa. Whoa. OK. Whoa. - Woo-woo-woo. - Woh. This is crazy. This is crazy. No no, Joy, be positive. I am positive this is crazy! Now! For Riley... For Riley... - Joy? - Hang on. Oh, I wish Joy was here. It's Joy! Stand back... Yah! - That worked. - Well, what would you do if you're so smart? I'd tell you, but you're too dumb to understand. - What? - Of course, your tiny brain is confused. Guess I'll just have to dumb it down to your level. Sorry I don't speak moron as well as you. But let me try. Duh! Arrrghh! Oh, thank goodness you're back! - Things are really messed up. - We found this idea... Oh no! Joy, you got to fix this. Get out there. - Sadness, it's up to you. - Me? - Sadness?! - Sadness?! - I can't, Joy. - Yes you can. Riley, needs you. OK. Wait, stop! I wanna get off. Alright, thank you, we will. Her teacher hasn't even seen Riley all day. - What? -What was she wearing last? - Can't believe this. - Do you remember what... - Riley! - There you are, thank goodness! Oh, we were worried sick. Where have you been? It's so late! (Riley, what happened? Are you alright?) I know you don't want me to, but, I miss home. I miss Minnesota. You need me to be happy. But, I want my old friends and hockey team. I wanna go home. Please don't be mad. - Oh, sweetie! - We're not mad. You know what? I miss Minnesota too. I miss the woods where we took hikes. And the backyard where you used to play. Spring Lake, where you learned to skate. Come here. Hey, I'm liking this new view. Friendship Island's expanded. Glad they finally opened that friendly argument section. I like Tragic Vampire Romance Island. Fashion Island! Oh, everyone shut up. Boy Band Island? That's just a phase. Say what you want, I think it's all beautiful. Alright, here you go. Your new expanded console is up and running. - Oh! - Wow! - Cool, upgrade. - Woo. Hey, ho ho! Whoops, did I just do that? OK.
