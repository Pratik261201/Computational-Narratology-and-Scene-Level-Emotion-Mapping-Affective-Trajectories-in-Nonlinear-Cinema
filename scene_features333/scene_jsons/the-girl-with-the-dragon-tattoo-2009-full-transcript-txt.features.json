Then the ride has started. I don't want to play devil's advocate, - - but it might be a good idea if Mikael took leave from Millennium. Till this thing's blown over. Merry Christmas. Wait, Micke. - They're in shock. - Only Janne dares to speak the truth. - I was set up. I'm a problem. - We just have to find a way. It's empty in here I haven't written a single word for months now. Do you understand? WENNERSTRÖM KNOCKS OUT BLOMKVIST GOING TO PRISON Damn. We don't normally introduce the researchers to our clients. But your client is special to us, so we'll make an exception. - It's much appreciated. - But I must warn you. - Lisbeth is a pretty odd girl. - What do you mean by odd? Make no mistake. She's the best researcher we have. Good morning, Lisbeth. Good morning. Dirch Frode. Transcripts of text messages. E-mails. Bank statements. How did you get access to all this? You order the goods. I deliver them. What can you tell me about Blomkvist? - It's all in my report. - The short version. Blomkvist was nicknamed after fictional boy detective Kalle Blomkvist - when he foiled a bank robbery in the eighties. He's a public figure without any big secrets. Read all the news clippings. - But he does have secrets? - Everyone has secrets. To what extent is he affected by the crisis at Millennium? - Financially, I mean. - Why don't you just read the report? Miss Salander, is there anything you'd like to add? What's your personal take on him? There's something fishy about the Wennerstrom case. What do you mean? There's more to the case? I'm researching Blomkvist, not doing his job. I'd just like to hear your personal opinion. I didn't find anything on him, not even speed fines. I don't think he faked any evidence against Wennerstrom. I think he was set up. Why didn't you ask me? - No lawyer could save me. - I know. I read the verdict. I didn't want to involve you. But you could've asked me. I'm your sister. - I know. - Good then, thanks. I'm already in the gutter. Why drag the family down with me? And you're going to prison. It's insane. - Sorry. I should have asked. - Yes. If you had done it ... Relax. Enough talk about rapists in the shower. Okay? The secret to good meatballs is to wet your fingers. When you roll them, rub your hands in opposite directions. - Damn. Will you answer it, please? - Ok. - Hello, this is Micke Blomkvist. - You little rascal. - This is Mikael. - Mikael Blomkvist? - Yes. Who's this? - My name's Dirch Frode. I'm a lawyer and I have a client who'd like to see you. - It's Christmas. What is it about? - My client will tell you himself. - Call Millennium after New Year's Eve. - My client doesn't like waiting. - Who's your client? - Henrik Vanger. From the Vanger Group? My client would be very grateful if you'd come. Listen, it's Christmas, and it's been a hell of a week. I promise you'll find it interesting. Blomkvist! Henrik lives on the island of Hedeby, a mile or two from Hedestad. The bridge is the only link to the mainland. In the old days, the Swedish business elite came here. Now it's just Henrik and his housekeeper Anna who live here. You will see Henrik now. Thank you for coming, Michael. Frode's call was pretty unusual. - Are you hungry? It's lunchtime. - No thanks. Let's get started. - I'm going back again today. - Right. No lunch then. Do you remember her? It's Harriet Vanger, my brother Gottfried's daughter. You've met her. This girl? Your father worked for me during the summer of 1965. He was a mechanical engineer at the plant and lived in a cottage here. You and your mother came for visits - - during the weekends. Harriet looked after you. You often played down there by the water. I remember her. - Harriet. - I never got any children of my own. Harriet was the apple of my eye. An incredibly smart girl. She was like a daughter to me. What happened to her? - I believe she was murdered. - Murdered? This is the Vanger family, Mikael. My family. September 22nd, 1966. On that day the family gathered in this house - - for the yearly board meeting. 30 small-minded and greedy people - - fighting for the biggest slice of the cake. One of these people ... ... killed Harriet. Harriet was 16 years old. It was Children's Day. She'd been to Hedestad to watch the parade in the main street. This picture was in the local paper. She returned to the island around two o'clock. She wanted to talk to me about something, but ... I was busy with the Board. How was she murdered? No one knows. She just disappeared. You're well prepared. I had 40 years to think about that day. That's what I call preparation. Quarter after two there was a serious road accident on the bridge. A tanker truck of gasoline crashed into a car. The tanker was blocking the bridge. It spilled gasoline all over the place. Nobody could get past. Everyone had to stay on the island. By chance, a photographer caught this. Look at the window. It is the last picture taken of Harriet. Officer Morell from Hedestad Police was in charge of the investigation. He found this film and had the photo blown up. Since then nobody has seen her. We waited for her at dinner, but she never turned up. - Hello? - Lisbeth Salander? - Who's this? - Anna Smith, probation department. - You have a new guardian: Bjurman. - I already have one. Your last guardian is in South Hospital with a stroke. Therefore, we found a replacement. You fucking idiot. What if she simply ran off? You have to keep the accident in mind. The bridge was closed for 24 hours. That's the only way off the island. So Harriet disappeared when nobody could leave. It was only the next day we started thinking there might be a crime. But then the bridge was open and the killer could've disposed of the body. She could have drowned, killed herself. We dragged for her body. We had tracker dogs and divers everywhere. Even today, when I go for a walk, I look for her. When Harriet was eight, she gave me a birthday present. A framed bluebell from 1958. After that she gave me a new flower each year. 1966 The year Harriet vanished. We're going to the attic. Unbelievable. Every damn year I get a flower on my birthday From different parts of the world. - Who would have sent the flowers? - Harriet's murderer. You don't know my family. You don't know what they are capable of. Harriet was my favorite. That made her the ideal victim for those - - who wanted more power in the Vanger Group. They wanted to crush me. I am 82 years old. The police gave up long ago. I'm afraid to go to the grave without knowing. Help me make one last attempt to find out what happened. - Why me? - I've followed your career. You're a damn good reporter. Persistent. I'm not asking you to solve the mystery. Just give it a try. You've six months before you have to serve your sentence. You've devoted 40 years to... I'll pay you a substantial fee. You'll be well off. You've nothing to lose. Nothing's waiting for you in Stockholm. Come in. Luckily we managed to get together despite the holidays. Please sit down. It's a little unfortunate Palmgren has had such a lax attitude towards guardianship law. I see you were allowed to control your own finances. - There haven't been any problems. - No, maybe not. But as your guardian, I'm legally and financially responsible. So I'm to blame if you suddenly can't come up with your rent. I work. I earn my own money. Yes, I can see you work for Milton Security... - What do you do? - I make coffee and photocopies. This is what we'll do: From now on your pay will be deposited into a new account that I administer. Each month you'll get a small amount for personal necessities, - - but all other expenses have to be approved by me. Okay? How do you look after your personal hygiene? What do you mean? With all those rings. Don't you get infections? Do you have a boyfriend? No. Have you ever had sex? I'm 24. So how many have you had sexual intercourse with? I am your guardian and responsible for you in every way, so ... In fact it is my duty, my job to ask you questions. - How many have you had sex with? - It's my private life. I can write here that you are cooperating Or that you are problematic and obstinate. And then your life'll get harder very quickly. So how many people have you had sex with? - Two. - Two? 200. No, 2000. - 200'000. Are we done now? - What kind of sex then? Any special preferences? \"Blomkvist resigns from the board and will no longer work for Millennium.\" Did you write this press release without talking to me? Only I could make that decision. What now? - I'll work for Henrik Vanger. - Henrik Vanger? I see. So now you're working for the big capitalists? It's not for the Vanger Group. You're gonna stay there? In Hedestad? Have a nice trip. Come on now ! What are you looking at? - What the fuck? - What are you doing, you fucking bitch? That bitch is going down. - Fucking bitch ! - Get her ! - She's crazy! - Fucking cunts, come on then! Come on. Shit. - Hello? - It's Lisbeth. What do you think? - I can save the hard drive. - Good. And the rest? You have to go shopping. - How did it happen? - Never mind. - You stink of beer. - And maybe you just had a bath? You can borrow my old computer. I use it for backup, so it has to stay here. Welcome to Hedeby. Wonderfully refreshing with this icy weather. You didn't want to stay in the main building. I hope you'll like it here. If it gets any colder, the pipes will freeze. Then you'll have to come to me for water. I arranged for the fire. Here is phone and broadband, so you can get in contact with the outside world. Yes? Just let them here. It's some of the stuff I've collected over all these years. There are photographs. Police reports. News articles. Even some of Harriet's belongings. Well, it's a start. You were a beautiful babysitter. What happened to you? Keep Sweden pure! We are the Swedish National Socialists - - and the Aryan race can't do without us! All in all, the Vangers are a pretty unpleasant bunch. Most of us hate each other, but are forced together by the business. My brother Harald lives in there. We don't get along, to put it mildly. Your brothers Richard and Harald joined a Nazi group in the 30's. I see... You already know about that. Gottfried was a member of the Hitler Youth. All three were Nazis. Yes. And fanatics, at that. Richard died in the Finnish Winter War. Harald has turned into a bitter, old man. He never leaves the house. Harald's daughter Cecilia is currently in Scotland. Cecilia and Harold are not on speaking terms. Martin lives up there. Harriet's brother. He took over the Vanger Group after me. Hi. Well, well. If it isn't the famous Kalle Blomkvist. Just call me Mikael. Then I know who you're talking to. I'm off to StockhoIm, but let us eat dinner. Thanks, I cannot refuse. I'm eager to hear why on earth - - you are to spend six months in this godforsaken place. Martin's and Harriet's father, Gottfried, - - led a miserable, alcoholic life with his wife Isabella. I've never seen a woman be as bad a mother as Isabella was to Harriet. I stepped in and took Harriet and Martin under my wing. And that's all of the Vangers who live here. On that day, even more joined us. Cecilia's sister Anita who died from cancer. - Greger Vanger and Ulrika Vanger. - Wait a minute. Who do you suspect? Nobody. And everybody. That's where you come into the picture. Dear Diary. Today I got this diary from my dear uncle Henrik. A kind, but busy, man. He's finally home from his travels and brought me this diary. I'm by myself in my dad's cottage. Anita will be here soon. So you're the one sniffing around in family matters? Hell, you scared me. Cecilia Vanger. Henrik said you'd be here. - Mikael Blomkvist. - I recognize you from the papers. - What have you found? - Harriet's Bible. She was often up here with my sister. - Anita? - Yes. The summer before she disappeared. - Odd, seeing that her father died here. - Gottfried died here? He was drunk and fell into the lake. They found him the next morning. Down by the jetty. It happened the year before Harriet disappeared. Henrik said you were traveling. I had to come home in order to hide Harriet's body. We weren't allowed to be here when we were kids. It was off-limits. Thanks. You are Harold's daughter. So is Martin your cousin? Yes. It's not easy to keep track throughout the family. Martin and me are the only ones who are glad you're here. Besides Henrik. It does not happen so much here on the island. See you. I was very flattered when you rang. And maybe a little surprised. You stayed neutral in the media during the worst mudslinging. The reason why you're here today - - Is that you are a top candidate for the job of Communications Director- - For Wennerstrom Group. You have a large network and diplomatic talent. You are also known to be an astute strategist. When can you start? - I can start immediately. - Excellent. I just need to quit Millennium first. I thought actually, you could wait to resign. Wait? But I must begin to work for you now? You start with me, but continues at Millennium. If you understand. Mikael Blomkvist is gone. Nobody will continue to investigate you. Possibly, but Millennium made a living hell for me - - Everyone knows that you will soon quit. I would sleep better at night if I knew what's going on in there. Do you understand what I mean? Yes ... Dear Diary. It's fall now. The weather's getting colder. Magda 30112 Sara 32016 BJ 32027 LJ 31208 Mari 32018 I do not understand why Henrik hired you. To be honest, neither do I. With all respect, there's nothing to find. It's been nearly 40 years. You found Harriet's diary in her dad's cottage. - The diary didn't help us one bit. - What about the phone numbers? - They were a complete mystery to us. - But 32 is... 32 could be Hedestad. 30 is Norrbyn's area code. But the names and the numbers don't match. - Did you call them up? - We did. We even tried backwards. We switched them, removed numbers. We tried everything. In the report, she's described as withdrawn and religiously inclined. Was that your impression? Who isn't withdrawn at that age? But yes, she kept to herself. Anita, her cousin, knew her best. Anita is Cecilia Vangen sister. And Anita is dead. She died many years ago. Harriet was my first case. I thought about this every day for nearly 40 years. I'm retiring this summer. It's only now that I'm able to let it go. There is no answer. You'll only breathe life into Henrik's obsession. Give up before you become obsessed yourself. What are you working on? Plague calling Wasp. Plague calling Wasp. Hello. - Who is this week's victim? - Nobody. Still that reporter? I thought you were done with him. Why do you keep at it? Yes, it's a little slow, I know. A new computer? - Yes, I need 20'000. - Why do you need a 20'000 kroner PC? - Play games, surf the internet. - Do you surf a lot? Do you chat? Know what, Lisbeth? I can't just hand you 20'000. - Not just like that. - How hard can it be? Why can't I manage my account? Hit me back. Do it. That's what you want. Hit me then. If you give me any kind of trouble, I'll make sure - - you spend the rest of your life in a closed ward. I know all about your mental problems and violent background. Don't get me wrong, Lisbeth... I'm more than happy to give you the 20'000. But, you know, any business transaction - - is built on trust. I have to feel that I can trust you. Can I trust you, baby? Can I trust you, Lisbeth? Can I trust you? If you're nice to me ... If you're nice to me I'll always be nice to you. - It's only 7'000. - More than enough for a computer. What are you looking at? - Henrik Vanger. - It's Michael. Has something happened? What time is it? You said it was a photographer from the paper that shot the parade. - Yes, that and the traffic accident. - Are you on the newspaper's board? - No, but I am a partner. - Good. The old part of the archive is a jumble. We haven't digitized it. It's still kept in negative folders. 20 ... 30 ... ... 40, 50, 60 ... A photographer uses between two and ten rolls a day. Probably closer to ten on Children's Day. Here. September 1966. I only need the hour when the parade took place. - Knock yourself out. - They're not sorted? If you're lucky, they might be chronological. You don't happen to have a negative scanner and a light table? This is the first lead in the case in 39 years. It's a start. It's more than that. Look. You get my drift? Something catches her eye. What is it that frightens her? Her murderer. Around here across the street - - Is Harriet's murderer. - Coffee, Mikael? - What have you found so far? I must have read ... ...several thousand pages. People have worked on this for 40 years. To be perfectly honest, - - I haven't found a thing. Shouldn't you be in Stockholm trying to appeal your verdict? - Give it a break. - You give it a break. - Mikael's old enough to... - I was lured into a trap. An old class-mate gave me a tip concerning Wennerstrom's company. It was a good story. Good enough to nail him. So you'd think. Yes, because suddenly there was an even better story - - about fraud and gun-running amounting to 60 million kroner. Wennerstrom's name was all over it. So far, so good. Until I wrote the story. Then all my sources disappeared. And all documents and evidence turned out to be forged. Fake? So it was an attempt to lure you away from the real scandal? It was too good to be true. You want something that really is too good to be true? Single malt. 21 years old. To hell with all the troubles of the past. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. How about one last glass of wine? I think I've had more than enough. - Thanks for a nice evening. - Is it because of the investigation? Because of my secretive family? - What do you mean? - It could be me. Right? I am also on your list of suspects. Erika Berger. I can't take the phone, leave a message. Hi, Erika. Call me. Hello, Micke. Hello. - What are you doing here? - Same to you. - Welcome to the country. - Yes, you can really say that. - What's all this about? - It's my life nowadays. - No, it's ok. - I can see that. How nice you have it here. - How are you? - We keep spirits up. - I believe in you. - There is no me nowadays. Only our small magazine which is about to go under. - How is she, the new one? - Malin? She is actually really good. She fights. She reminds me of myself 40 years ago. But we still need you. Henrik Vanger has asked whether we will eat lunch with him. - When have you spoken to him? - I was happy to get to know where you lived. - Is this a problem? - No, not for me. - We will only talk about my job. - Oh, man talk. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. So it's you who has abducted my editor. Now I thought that we would begin by talking business - - And then we can enjoy the food in peace and quiet. - Business? - Have you not told about our talk? - I wanted to surprise him. - What are you doing? - Henrik will invest in Millennium. - Have you gone behind my back? Do you have a right to interfere with, how I save Millennium? - I have the right to have an opinion. - Which is? To a radical journals' alliance with an industrialist, lookin' good. We have to save the journal. It may seem hypocritical, but I will not go back in. I hate when newspapers lose their integrity due to shareholders. - What do you want with Millennium? - Erika has conducted extensive research. She knows I have a weakness for projects that all others have given up on. You should have known, Mikael. - Cheers. - Cheers. I was stubborn. You were right. - Are you going with it? - I'll just finish this.. Take care of yourself. - Bjurman. - It is Lisbeth. - What do you want? - I need more money. - We'll talk about it. - I need it now. Welcome. Come in and take the jacket off. - I just want my money. - You'll get your money. Thanks for your last visit. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. I won't give you a blowjob every time I need money. Is that right? Then what do you want? Do you want me to call the probate department and say - - you've trespassed and you're threatening me? Then we'll see how quickly you're back in the psychiatric ward. So? That's much better. Like that. Come here. Come on. No! I've got... a rule for you to learn. If you put up a fight... Are you a good girl? Are you a good girl now? NORSJ?CARPENTERS My husband died many years ago. So it's just me left. He worked there as a carpenter for 24 years. They made everything from clothes pegs to closets. He built that cabinet. And the lamp, of course. More cake? Do you recall if you were in Hedestad in September 1966? Hedestad... - In '66. - Yes, in '66. - Oh, it was our honeymoon. - Wonderful. Do you have snapshots? We went camping. It was all the rage back then. It was our best holiday together. But I guess honeymoons often are. - But do you have some snapshots? - I sure do. Who doesn't save the photos from their honeymoon? In the early years, my husband and I hiked a lot. My husband was a skilled hiker. We hiked for miles. He wasn't exactly romantic. Now let's see. Hedestad... Look. So beautiful. Even if the photo doesn't do the sunset justice. Now let's see. Here's something. - There was a parade. - Did you ... - Cheers for Henrik Vanger! - Henrik Vanger! I got a negative from Micke, I should make it sharper. - What the hell is he doing up there? - He is a detective. - Sherlock Holmes. - Cheers to Sherlock Holmes. Malin? I was going out for a beer. To celebrate our new investors. Coming? - What? Just the two of us? - Yes. Why not? - Wait a minute. - Okay. Sorry. I sent an email to Micke - - And it ended up on your computer. How strange. Probably to do with the server. It's happened sometimes before. - There's nothing we can do. - How strange. Shall we go? - What do you think? - looks good. It's pretty sensitive down there so it'll probably hurt. Here we go. - There are different kinds of needles? - Yeah How big is the biggest? I can show you afterwards. What the hell are you doing here? I was on my way out. You've misunderstood the rules. You have to make an appointment. Do you hear me? Let me go. Do you hear me? Let me go. Do you like being tied up? Or is your only turn-on tying other people up? It's great. Did you choose it yourself? You didn't? I think it's perfect. You know that show where politicians get busted by candid cameras? We've got those cameras at work. I had one in my bag last time I was here. Welcome. I just thought you'd make me give you a blowjob. But you're sicker than I imagined. It goes on for two hours. Consider the reaction of the police and the media. Enjoy. Thanks for your last visit. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. I won't give you a blowjob every time I need money. Is that right? Then what do you want? I'll tell you how we'll do this. You just nod. I'll look after my own account. You'll have no access. I control my own finances. You got that? Each month you write in your report that my behavior is perfect. Better than ever before. In exactly a year, you'll apply for the termination of my guardianship. I'll send you further instructions. You can never contact me again. If you do, I'll send copies of the video to the police and the press. The same thing happens, if I'm in an accident - - Or you break my rules. You got that? Good. I've never done this before. Lie still or it'll get messy. Lie still. I'M A SADIST PIG AND A RAPIST find Blomkvist portable connect Blomkvist ...during the last year... ...an avid interest in religion. SEND The guy in the blue sweater. I can't get his picture sharp. I can't do a thing about it. It's so out of focus. - Are you sure? - Positive. I've tried everything. Okay, thanks for trying. Wasp ... Harriet's phone numbers. Book of Leviticus... \"If a woman approaches an animal...\" \"If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, - - kill both the woman and the animal. Their blood will be on their own heads.\" Mari 32018 Magda 30112 Leviticus, Chapter 1, Verse 12 \"...she is to bring two doves or two young pigeons, - - one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering.\" BJ 32027 \"A man or a woman... \"A man or a woman who is a medium or spiritist among you - - must be put to death. You are to stone them.\" Must be put to death. - Frode! What's going on? - It was Henrik. He just collapsed. It's a heart attack. He's having emergency surgery. - What are his odds? - They're talking about a bypass, so it's serious. - Want a cup of coffee? - No. I think you should go on with your investigation. - Have you assigned someone else? - No, only you. Someone by the name of Wasp has hacked into my computer. I've received an e-mail with copies of one of my own documents. So this person must have gained access to my hard drive. Do you know anything about this? No. ... No, but I think I've got a good idea - - who it might be. Just stay in bed. Lisbeth Salander? - Who are you? - You know. May I come in? I've read your report. Thrilling stuff. Particularly that you stole my files. The police would find that intriguing. They also ought to know that you are still hacking into my computer. If you remove those papers, I'll take off the chain. What do you want? - Hi. - Everything all right? - What do you want? - You got any coffee? How much do you know about my assignment? The 40-year-old murder of a 16-year-old girl. Until today I wasn't even sure that she was killed. Then you directed me to the Biblical references - - about women who should be killed. - And? - It's the most important clue so far. - And? - I need your help. - I'll pay good money. - I've already got a job. You work as a professional hacker, - - but send me an e-mail I can easily trace. Why? Huh? Hello. Welcome. So he'll live? Can I visit him? Lisbeth Salander's here. Okay, Frode. Talk to you soon. Thanks. If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations... As we've been sharing files lately, I assume you're up to date. I am. All this is suspicious. Everyone was on the island, when Harriet disappeared - - Except Richard and Gottfried, who had died. We know she is scared of somebody across the street. Quotes, blood and death. Brutal stuff as referenced in the diary. The day Harriet disappeared, she talked with the local priest, Otto Falk. They met a few times. Harriet was 16 years. Her family was not religious. Suddenly she starts to quote the bible and circumvented the local priest. - Why don't you have a car? - I care about the environment. - Do you send money to children in Africa? - You know that. It's in your report. Shall I take a ride? - Would you rather take the bus? - Damn ... Damn this. Stay at the back. Yes, Harriet. Poor girl. It went bad for her. Can you remember what you talked about? Why was she suddenly religious? She was not a true believer. Harriet was one of the teens who use God as a fad. She was restless. Harriet wrote some quotes down. Is there a connection? Weird girl. No, it seems completely random. She took nothing seriously. - She was also a troublemaker. - She is described as very introverted. No, she was very lively. There was always something happening. Sweden was too small for her. - That's probably why she moved. - Moved? - Yes, to London. - It's Anita he's talking about. - You have it mixed up, father. - No, she got cancer, poor girl. But Anita and Harriet were similar and were best friends. Anita moved to London and died of cancer. - Is Anita on your mind, father. - Yes, Anita. That's what I said. It's ok, father. Anita was Harriet's cousin, and you knew them? - We went to the same school. - Do you think of Harriet as religious? - And after Gottfried death? - She became more introverted. But he was not Christian. You know... What if these quotes don't have anything to do with God? What if it's a code? Sara Witt was found murdered in her family's barn - - outside Vilhelmina in 1962. Sara? What else does it say? \"Between 2 and 3 am, the victim was lured...\" \"The woman's body was mutilated, possibly in a religious ritual. The police won't disclose any more details.\" Mutilated, possibly religious... Did they find the killer? No. The case was never solved. - It's a wild guess. - I know. - How far is it to Vilhelmina? - Too far on a motorcycle. What are we waiting for? - You want to drive? - Why? - I haven't driven since my divorce. - Then it's about time. Why do female names always bring you to porn sites? What are you doing? I'm getting the computer to search all the newspaper databases. What was the journalist who wrote about Sara ...? Witt? Gunnar Brännlund. - Gunnar. - Hello. Mikael. Gunnar. Let's go to the barn. They couldn't sell the farm after what happened. It's been empty ever since. This is where she was found? Yes. Her husband found her. It was horrific for him. Horrific. She was lying right here. In this booth. Bound and tortured. Were the animals also harmed? How did you know? Several of the cows in the barn had been grossly abused. - Some had to be euthanized. - Was there any theories? No, but they arrested a young man which was strange enough. - How strange? - He was on the wrong side. - You mean homosexual? - Yes. - But he was not convicted of murder? - No, just the other filth. It was punishable at the time. For good reasons in my opinion. \"If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, - - kill both the woman and the animal.\" - It may be a coincidence. - Yes. Goddamn, Lisbeth. If the others also fit... I've found an old TV program. A program from 1999 about a murder in Dalarna. \"In the series 'Swedish Murders' comes the case of Magda Lovisa Sjöberg - - From Dalarna. \" Magda ... \"A brutal murder puzzle from November 1954 that baffled the police.\" - Didn't we have a Magda reference? - Leviticus, Chapter 1, Verse 12 \"He is to cut it into pieces... including the head and the fat.\" \"And the priest shall arrange them... on the burning wood on the altar.\" That was verbatim. You quoted it word for word. I think I found another. 17-year-old girl from Uppsala. Damn. When? 1964 \"Police seek witnesses desperately.\" \"Maris' murder has the streets deserted.\" We had very high ratings. So we must make a series of new programs on old murder mystery. It's my program host, Sally. Just a moment, then I'll see what I can find in the basement. Sally ... See what I found in the basement. You can follow along. As far as I know, Magda's body was found after only six hours. By a farmer who saw the smoke from the fire. He thought it was some kids having a party. Someone cut out fat from the body. That's right. They found remains of fat together with the head. Awful. - Thank you for your help. - Tell me if I can do anything else. Yes, indeed. Would it be ok to copy all of this? Sure. What the hell? Relax! I just wanted to wake you up. We're there. Damn ...! Can I come in? Here's your bag. Yes, I'm okay. I can't find anyone who fits the initials BJ. But LI could be Liv Ingvartsson. A prostitute who disappeared in Ånge and was found on a building site. What was that quote again? \"...she is to bring two doves, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering.\" \"The priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.\" Ånge... That's quite a few miles in the direction we came from. There. Now we've got Sara, Mari, Magda and Liv. Four murders. Now we only need BJ, who's been circled. Harriet can't have known them. Liv was murdered in 1949. Harriet was born in 1950. What's the connection? She listed women who'd been killed and she disappeared. - Harriet must've known who the killer was. - Yes. - It's great, Janne. - What fun. Now you must be fast. Otherwise we can't publish. -Erika, you have two seconds? -Yes. -Do not forget to call these. -No, I will do it. I've found that Janne has contact with Wennerstrom. How did you find out? I checked his email. I happened to see and ... He gets a copy of all documents sent or received here. If something is about Wennerstrom Janne forwards it to him. Janne ... So he's partner with Wennerstrom. Damn. What will you do? I have to fire him as soon as possible. - Are you sure it's the best? - What do you mean? Isn't it a great opportunity - - to have control on what Wennerstrom's told? Malin, what are you doing here on Millennium? You are politicians. I have to take a shower. What is it? Somebody's been here. The pictures have been touched. The Bible is pointing in another direction. - Look. - What the hell? Someone has been curious. I'll buy a new lock tomorrow. Lisbeth... do you have a photographic memory? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. It's fantastic if you do. I wish that I had it. Damn, you gave me a scare. What is it? What are you doing? Are you sure it's a good idea? - Are you leaving? - Good night. -Good morning. -Good morning. - Did you sleep well? - Mm. - I'm updating Henrik. Want to come? - I hate hospitals. All right. But that's... But that's totally absurd. You've found out more than I'd hoped for. The girl you've hired, is she good? She is ... she is talented. Sorry for the personality test - - but I would not let the wrong man in my personal business. It's okay. Just concentrate on getting well. - When will you print? - Not right away. But I'll probably trip on me, to the Vangers' family chagrin. They have called for a meeting where you stand at the top of the agenda. Harriet's mother Isabella would like that we suspend the investigation. I will continue. All the way. I'll keep you updated. Regarding the last reference... The last name. - BJ. - Ask Morell if he can help you. He's not too fond of me. He is equally obsessed about the Harriet case. Give him another chance. He is the chief. Morell! Morell! What the hell? Five murders?! - It wasn't phone numbers - If it's any consolation, It wasn't me who discovered it. - We need your help now. - What do you want? We haven't found the last woman with the initials BJ. She's circled as if she's particularly important. It's the last reference. The local police must go through with their investigations. If there's a woman with these initials who died in the 40's, 50's or 60's, - - we've got to find her. Do you know if the victims had anything in common; something that the killer went on about? It seems random, apart from Bible quotes and that all are women. Do you realize what this means? If the first murder took place in 1949, - - the man who's been sending Henrik flowers is now very old. It reduces the number of suspects considerably. Mikael. We're glad you could make it. Welcome. Harald couldn't make it. He's hunting deer. - To what do I owe the honor? - Have you read the local paper recently? - I've been out of town. - That's right. They're coming out with quite an interesting series - - on your exile here on Hedeby. BLOMKVIST'S YOUNG NEW GIRLFRIEND - And? - We don't like it. Henrik is dying. And scandals are relentless. My private life has nothing to do with my assignment for Henrik. It reflects on everyone in the Vanger Group. Do you have to give Henrik a heart attack by picking over my daughter's death? And you have forced him to invest in your propaganda newspaper. Mikael is hired by Henrik and has only done his duty. - Maybe it's about time you gave up. - What do you mean? You're making matters worse by coming here with your whore. Don't use that tone, Mom. But maybe you should take a break now. It's been a pretty hard deal. - I'm needed here. - You are needed at Millennium as well. What's Millennium got to do with it? I am Henriks' deputy. One of the conditions of Henriks' investment was no interference. - Mikael, as your friend... - Excuse me, but I have something to say... Henrik signed a binding contract. As long as he lives, it cannot be cancelled. So whether Mikael likes it or not, he has to continue. I'm sorry that it had to be so dramatic. - Why are you wearing Harriet's necklace? - What do you mean? Harriet was wearing it when she disappeared. Now you're wearing it. What are you trying to say? Are you accusing me? Just tell me where you got it from. I inherited it from Anita. It never belonged to Harriet. Anita, your sister? When you came, I thought: \"something new is happening.\" That it was beneficial to have healthy blood in this vicious colony. But you are more of the same. You are as obsessed as Henrik. It flashes. Hi, Micke. Everything all right? Anita is Harriet. I was mistaken. It's not her. What are you talking about? They both looked after me that summer. It's Anita's necklace. Yes, it's Anita. Shit, those two were so alike. - What do we know about Anita Vanger? - Harriet's cousin and closest friend. They were together each summer. She had no alibi, but wasn't a suspect. Right after Harriet's death, she moved to London to study. She had a brilliant career, but died from breast cancer when she was 37. She died 20 years ago. She didn't tell Morell it was her in the window. - Maybe she had something to hide. - Maybe she was covering for the killer. Hi, Plague. I need help. Will you run a check on Anita Vanger? -Plague? -Is there anything to find, he finds it. - What happened? - Some idiot shot at me. May I see. - Did you see who? - No. Shit. You must go into the shower. We must be very close now. And someone doesn't like it. - We need to go to the police. - What the hell can they do? - Give me my cell phone. - Then I'm out of here. Let's not jump to any conclusions. - It could be a hunting accident. - No. - I'll look into it. - I hope so. If it's not a hunting accident, then you're not safe here. I think you should go home. At least for a while. Ever since I came here, everyone keeps asking me to leave. Anything new on BJ? We didn't find a BJ in the system. But we'll keep on searching. There are no bullets here. No cartridge cases. Can't find anything. - How did it go? - I was sitting at the police station for seven hours. They think it is a hunting accident. - What is all this? - From Milton Security in Stockholm. I put two cameras out and four inside linked to motion detectors. Fantastic. I take it you don't want to go home? No. So now we've got it on tape? Yes. It's already on the internet. - What are you doing? - Sorry? - Go sleep in your own bed. - I want to be close to you. Okay, but I want to sleep. What has happened to you? How did you turn out this way? You know everything about me. I don't know shit about you. Not a damn thing. Yes, that's the way it is. - Who is it? - Morell. I found the last one. Rebecka Jacobsson, nickname Bea. BJ. That's why we didn't find her. \"A man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist among you... ...must be put to death. You are to stone them.\" It's her. - Where was she murdered? - In Karlstad. But that's not the interesting part. Rebecka worked for the Vanger Group until her death in January 1965. As a secretary for Gottfried Vanger. Gottfried died before Harriet disappeared. So it wasn't him. But we've got to check if she knew other members of the Vanger family. - Did you study the files? - They are on their way from Karlstad. Wait, wait. Rebecka and Sara are Jewish names. -Magda ...? -Magdalena. Mari, Maria. But Liv? Liv means Eve. I bet that Liv Ingvartsson was Jewish as well. Racist murders. It fits with the pseudo religious rituals. But what about Harriet? Harriet died because she discovered a pattern. How the hell could we miss it? They're Jewish names. There were three Nazis in the Vanger family. Only one was still alive when Harriet died. Harald. Who happened to be hunting when you ran alone in the woods. The first murder took place there in 1949. Then Dalarna, Vilhelmina, Uppsala, Karlstad. If Harald has been there, he's left traces. - What do you mean? - The Vanger Group accounts. Business travels. There must be evidence. Restaurant and hotel bills. You think he got a tax deduction for murder? Well, I know about businessmen. Even if we can prove he's been everywhere, it's not enough. - Maybe he's hunting now. - You suggest we break into his house? We have our own auditors inside Hedestad. Have you kept all records since then? Yes, it ... May I ask what you're looking for? Preferably not, but we'll tell you later. I'll call Frode and arrange it. Mikael! I'm sorry for what happened at the meeting. I did not want to discourage you - - But it is like a spine, Vanger family comes first. It's ok. -How's your head? -Good. Take care of yourself. We need to go back quite a few years. 89... 89... We need the accounts from 1949 until 1966. Thank Henrik for his old-fashioned business practices. Otherwise, they would've been shredded long ago. Well, there they all are, knock yourself out. Miss Salander, what exactly have you found so far? Thank you, that was all. Stockholm ... IN THE NAME OF THE FÜHRER I BESTOW... What in God's name are you doing here? Answer me! Take it easy. You're gonna write about me in your damn communist magazine? I'm leaving now. Don't shoot. You broke into my home, so I'm free to kill you. What the hell is going on here? -Freeze! -Drop the gun, Harald. - Come on, drop the gun. - It's none of your business! Drop the gun. Drop it. Are you okay? How the hell could Gottfried have such a wuss of a son? Harald ... No. - We've got to call Morell. - We can call him from my place. Harald's not going anywhere. Come on. Gottfried? Gottfried. Uppsala 1964 Let's see, Uppsala ... What the hell ...? Could it be? Blue shirt. What the hell? Damn. Feeling better now? - He gave me a hell of a scare. - You don't mess with Harald. What were you doing in his house? We know that Harriet discovered a series of ritual murders from the 40's to the 60's. We know she found a pattern the police didn't know about. We believe that's why she was killed. But that... It sounds totally insane. We've found a pattern regarding the victims. They've all got Jewish names. Well, Harald isn't exactly crazy about Abraham's kin. I thought he was out, So I went in to see if I could find anything. - And? - Well, what do I know? He turned up so soon. But he didn't exactly act innocent. If Lisbeth can track down his travel activities from the accounts, - - we've got evidence against him. Bills, invoices. She's going through everything. Very well. I'll call the police. Try Morell. What were you doing at Harald's? There, there. Scream as much as you want to, Mikael. Scream as much as you can. You think anyone'll hear you? We both know how it's going to end for you. Why? Why what? - All of this. - Why not? I do what every man dreams of. I take what I want. How many women after the first? I don't know. I've lost count. I had a girl in that cage when we were dining upstairs. Those kinds of women disappear all the time. Nobody misses them. Whores, immigrants. What do you do with them? What about the references? The mutilations? That was my father's project. He mixed his hobby with race and religion. But it was a mistake. You shouldn't leave the bodies behind. I take them for a trip in my boat and then I drop them into the sea. Mikael? Mari was my first. 64. You were 16 years old. It was Dad, Gottfried, who taught me how I should strangle her. It's sick. It's mainly for the sex. When I put them down, it's only a logical consequence of the rape. You can't leave any witnesses. Even though I have to admit I love seeing their disappointment. - Disappointment? - When they realize they'll die. It doesn't really fit into their scheme of things. They always think I'll show them mercy. It's a fantastic moment - - when they realize they're not going to get away. When the eyes... ...switch off and die. You'll experience that yourself. And your sister? What did it feel like when your sister's eyes died? - Harriet disappeared. - You want me to believe that? Believe whatever the hell you want. I would have enjoyed killing her. But she disappeared. Just like you'll disappear. Do you want some water? Yes, please. Thanks. You see... you're just like everybody else. It only takes a simple, human gesture to ignite the small hope - - that I might let you go after all. Right? Take it easy. It'll be quick. I'm mostly looking forward to your little girlfriend. Come on, motherfucker. Are you okay? Damn! I can't... I can't move. I can't move myself. Help me. Please, help me. - Where's Martin? - He's not coming back. What do you mean? He drove to his death. - He's finished. - Are you positive? What the hell did you do? He died in a car accident. We don't know anything. Okay? Blomkvist! - What the hell happened here? - The cellar. What really happened out there? He did not die in some accident, huh? Damn, Lisbeth. He was trained by his father to murder since he was 16 years old. That would make anybody sick in the brain. Don't make him into a fucking victim. He nearly killed you. He was a killer and a rapist and he enjoyed it. He had the same chances as everyone else. You choose who you want to be. He wasn't a victim. He was an evil pig who hated women. How did he die? He burned to death. - Could you have saved him? - Yes. - But you let him burn. - Yes. I would never have done that, Lisbeth. But I understand why you did it. I don't know what you've been through. But I almost died in that cellar - And you saved my life. Whatever it is you've been through, - - you don't have to tell me. I'm just glad you're here. Thanks. For the first time in my life I feel old. What now? We need to figure out all the womens' identities. The victims' relatives must be informed. We contact those we find and tell them what happened. Can you we make up for it? Can we? with financial compensation? No ... Yes, Mikael ... You have received the story of the decade. So now you have something to do when you sit in jail. It's a good story. But I will not write it. How can I thank you? You have solved a mystery which spanned too many years of my life. It was my first case. I think it should be the last. - We're not finished yet. - What do you mean? - Harriet wasn't one of Martins' victims. - What are you saying? Martin didn't kill Harriet. Lisbeth? Two women bear the name Anita Vanger. One of them died in London. The other one lives in Australia. First entry into the country in 1966. Harriet? Harriet Vanger? Everything's all right? Have we met before? Yes. You and your cousin babysat me when I was a small boy. But I'm here on behalf of Henrik Vanger. Does he know I'm alive? Not yet. Are you here to tell me my brother died in a car accident? - How do you know that? - We have internet out here also. Your brother did this. He almost killed me. It doesn't surprise me. I'm here to visit Agneta Salander. - Who can I say it is? - Her daughter. Her daughter? Are you Agneta's daughter? I'm sorry, it's just... I've never seen you before. Visit. Agneta Salander. All right. Room 314. Hi, Mom. Mom? It's me. Lisbeth. Lisbeth? I wanted to come a long time ago. You look so different now. - Do you have kids? - No. A boyfriend? There is someone... ...but you should never fall in love. You know that better than anyone. Right, Mom? I should have picked a better father for you. Let it be, Mom. It was you he harmed. Mom ... Come in! Mikael. Welcome back. I've got a nice surprise. Promise me you won't have a heart attack. With all the pills I'm popping at the moment, - - I think it's physically impossible to have a heart attack. Harriet? Forgive me. I'm sorry. I was 14 when Dad raped me for the first time. A year later he took me to his cottage. Then Martin joined in. They abused me again several times after that. One day I'd had enough. Dad was drunk as usual. He reeled off Bible verses and boasted about all the women he'd killed. I took the oar and hit him hard. I pressed him under the water till it got still. Then I pushed the boat out to make it look like an accident. But when I turned around... ...Martin was there. Martin treated me even worse than Gottfried. You sent him to a boarding school in Uppsala, - - but on Children's Day he came back. I was terrified it would start all over again. And then you went to Anita? Anita helped me get out of here. When the bridge was opened, she drove the car. I was in the back seat under a blanket. I've been thinking of you all these years. I sent you the framed flowers - - because I wanted to tell you that I was out there somewhere. So I was sad to hear Mikael say what you'd read into them. If you hadn't sent them, you wouldn't be sitting here now. No. Lisbeth, it's me again. Call me if you hear this. I hope you're doing okay. Call me. You have a visitor. Half an hour. I am so happy to see you. Here. - What's this? - A bit of reading. - Don't you want to sit down? - I just wanted to give you that. I've only got a month and a half left.
